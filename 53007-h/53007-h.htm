<p class="small">SIR,</p>

<p>The following Work is the fruit
of several years labour employed in
the Public Service, chiefly under that
great and successful Admiral, Lord
Rodney, in a series of Naval Operations,
which have been productive of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
events more glorious than any recorded
in the Annals of Britain. As
your Royal Highness was present during
some part of the service which is
the subject of these Observations, and
as You have not only honoured the
Sea Service by embracing it as a profession,
and enrolling your illustrious
Name among its officers, but in undergoing
the dangers and fatigues of
actual service, which is so necessary to
attain that practical Skill which Your
Royal Highness is well known to possess,
I have, upon these grounds, presumed
to lay this Work at Your feet.
I should do this with greater satisfaction,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
were it more worthy of Your acceptance;
but however inadequate my
abilities may have been to the talk,
it has been my sincere aim to produce
a work of some utility to that only
Bulwark of our Country, the British
Navy, of which your Royal Highness
is the Pride and the Hope.</p>

<p>Your Royal Highness’s Permission
to inscribe this work to You, and
the personal Notice and Protection
with which you have been pleased to
honour me, I consider as the first
Distinctions of my life, and of which
I shall ever entertain a becoming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
sense, by cherishing those indelible
sentiments of Respect, Gratitude, and
Attachment, which are due to Your
Royal Highness from</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Having been appointed by Lord Rodney
Physician to the Fleet under his command,
in the beginning of the year 1780, I determined
to avail myself, to the utmost of my
abilities, of the advantages which this field
of observation afforded. This I was led to
do, in order to satisfy my own mind as a
matter of duty, as well as to find out, if
possible, the means of bettering the condition
of a class of men, who are the bulwark
of the state, but whose lot is hardship
and disease, above that of all others.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>A fleet, consisting seldom of less than
twenty ships of the line of battle, and
sometimes exceeding forty, which I attended
in the different scenes of active service in
that distant and unhealthy region, for more
than three years, has afforded me opportunities
of making observations upon a large
scale.</p>

<p>My object has been prevention as much as
cure; and as the former must more particularly
depend on a knowledge of the external
causes of disease, I have collected and arranged
all the facts upon this subject that
came within my reach, considering these as
the only grounds from whence the remote
causes of health and sickness could be deduced.</p>

<p>When I entered upon my employment, the
Commander in Chief gave an order, that
every surgeon in the fleet should send me a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
monthly return, stating the degree of prevalence
of different diseases, the mortality,
and whatever else related to the health of
the respective ships. This was done with
a view to enable me to regulate the reception
of men into hospitals, so that each ship
might have a due proportion of relief, according
to the degree of sickness on board,
taking care at the same time that the hospitals
should not be overcrowded; and also
to acquaint the Commander in Chief, from
time to time, of the state of sickness, or
the predominance of particular diseases, in
order to recommend such articles of diet,
or other means, as might tend to cure them,
or to check their progress. These returns
have served also in this work as a method
of collecting a multitude of well-established
facts, tending to ascertain the causes and
course of disease.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>While the fleet was in port, I also superintended
and visited daily the hospitals, of
which there is one at almost every island on
the station; and having kept an account of
the different kinds of disease that were admitted,
and of their mortality, I have in
this way likewise been furnished with a
number of facts that may throw light on
the history of human maladies.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I do not boast of having
made great discoveries; and every person of
a correct judgement must be aware how difficult
it is to ascertain truths, and to draw
fair and solid inferences, on medical subjects.
I have attempted little more than to
amass, from my own observation, and by
the assistance of the surgeons of the fleet, a
number of well-established facts, and to arrange
them in such a methodical manner, as
to prove a groundwork for investigation;
and I am persuaded that others, of more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
sagacity and enlarged knowledge than myself,
may be able to deduce from them, observations
that may have escaped me especially
if these new, but imperfect, attempts
should come to be compared with similar
ones that may be made by other observers in
other climates, and in other circumstances
of service.</p>

<p>I met with several obstacles in instituting
inquiries, purely medical, to the extent I
could have wished. There is, in the first
place, from the nature of the subject, a
great difficulty attending all practical inquiries
in medicine; for, in order to ascertain
truth, in a manner that is satisfactory to
a mind habituated to chaste investigation,
there must be a series of patient and attentive
observations upon a great number of
cases, and the different trials must be varied,
weighed, and compared, in order to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
form a proper estimate of the real efficacy of
different remedies and modes of treatment.</p>

<p>But besides this difficulty belonging to
the nature of the subject, there were others
connected with the nature of the service;
for the hospitals were at times so inadequate
in point of size, and so ill provided
with necessary articles and accommodations,
particularly during the first part of my attendance,
that my principal care was to remedy
these defects by proper superintendence
and representation.</p>

<p>A due attention to air, diet, and cleanliness,
is not only more essential than mere
medical treatment, but the sick cannot be
considered as fit subjects for evincing the
powers of medicine till they are properly
provided for in these respects. These inconveniences
were owing, in a great measure,
to the unusual extent of the service;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
for there was a much greater naval force in
those seas, at this period, than was ever
before known, and there was of course a
proportional want of accommodation for
the sick. Towards the end of the war
these difficulties were much obviated, so
that a fairer field of observation presented
itself.</p>

<p>Another obstacle to my practical inquiries
was, that the fleets I belonged to seldom
remained more than six weeks or two
months at any one place, so that any series
of observations that might have been instituted
was interrupted, and I was in a great
degree deprived of the fruits of them, by
not seeing the event of cases under my
management.</p>

<p>The peace in the spring of the year 1783
put an end to all my inquiries, and particularly
prevented me from following out some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
practical researches. I have ventured, however,
in one part of this work, to give the
result of my experience in some diseases,
more especially such as are peculiar to the
climate and mode of life.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, I have, in the following
work, humbly attempted to follow what I
conceive to be the only true method of cultivating
any practical art, that is, to collect
and compare a great number of facts. A
few individual cases are not to be relied on
as a foundation of general reasoning, the
deductions from them being inconclusive
and fallacious, and they are liable to be
turned and glossed, according as the mind
of the observer may he biassed by a favourite
prepossession or hypothesis. It has been
my study to exhibit a rigid transcript of
truth and nature upon a large scale, and to
take the average of numberless particular
facts, to serve as a groundwork for observation;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
and I have endeavoured to analyse
and collate these facts, by throwing the
monthly returns that were made to me into
the form of Tables, as the most certain
and compendious way for finding their general
result. If the materials are not sufficiently
ample, or if the method should be
found faulty and imperfect, let it be remembered,
that I had no example to go by in
this field of observation. It is to be regretted,
that ages have passed without any
attempts being made to transmit regular records
of this kind to posterity. It would
not only be extremely curious, as a piece
of natural knowledge, but would conduce
greatly to medical improvement and public
utility, were we possessed of such information
concerning the causes and nature of
the diseases prevailing at sea, in various circumstances
of weather, climate, and diet,
in remote ages and countries, or even in
our own age and country, as might enable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
us to compare them with present facts, and
to ascertain more precisely the means of
preventing and removing such diseases.</p>

<p>The favourable reception which the first
edition of this work has met with, renders
it necessary to offer another to the Public;
and though no new opportunities have occurred
of making additional observations in
the naval service I have endeavoured, during
the last two years, from a pretty extensive
experience in a large hospital, and from
private practice, to add some new information
on some practical points; and I hope
this edition will be found throughout more
full and correct than the former.</p>

<p>The method I propose to follow in this
work, is, First, to deliver the history of
the different voyages and expeditions, so far
as relates to health, giving an account of
the prevalence and nature of the diseases
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
and mortality on board of ships and in hospitals.</p>

<p>Secondly, To deduce, from observations
founded on these facts, and also from the
former experience of others, the causes of
sickness in fleets, and the means of prevention.</p>

<p>Thirdly, To deliver some practical observations
on the cure of the most common
diseases incident to fleets, particularly in hot
climates.

<p>During the war, which broke out
with France in 1778, and with Spain in
1779, the West Indies was the principal
seat of naval operations, and much greater
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
fleets were then employed in that quarter of
the world than in any former period.</p>

<p>Though there had been a great squadron
on the Caribbee station during the greater
part of 1779, no physician was appointed
to it till the beginning of the next year,
when I arrived there in that character with
my friend and protector, Lord Rodney.</p>

<p>There were then sixteen ships of the line
on that station, most of which had been
upwards of twelve months in the climate;
and they were reinforced at this time by five
more from England.</p>

<p>The squadron which we found on the
station was then extremely healthy, and in
several of the ships there was not a man
unfit for duty. We were told, however,
that they had all been subject to sickness,
particularly to the dysentery, soon after
their arrival in that climate. Of the five
with which the fleet was at this time reinforced,
all but the Intrepid left England
at Christmas, making part of the squadron
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
which effected the first relief of Gibraltar,
under the command of Lord Rodney, who
continued his route to the West Indies, in
order to take the command on the Windward
station, where he arrived on the 16th
of March. The Intrepid had arrived with
a convoy the day before. These five ships
were all pretty healthy on their passage, except
the Sandwich and Terrible, in which
a fever prevailed; but they had almost recovered
from it before they arrived in the
West Indies. A dysentery broke out in
April in all the ships newly arrived, and it
prevailed to the greatest degree in those
which had been most affected with fevers
in Europe, namely, in the Terrible and
Intrepid. The Sandwich and Ajax were
also affected, though in a less degree; but
the Montagu, though this was her first
voyage, and though she was just off the
stocks, had been the most healthy of any
of them from the time of leaving England,
and continued so during all this campaign.
I have not observed that new ships are more
unhealthy than others, unless they are built
of ill-seasoned timber; and they have this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
advantage, that there is no previous infection
adhering to them. What may have
contributed also to the superior health of
the Montagu, was the precaution that was
taken when this ship was first manned and
fitted out, of stripping and washing the
men that were brought from the guardship
to complete the crew.</p>

<p>The Intrepid, while in England, had been
afflicted with fevers to a most uncommon
degree; for, being one of the fleet in the
Channel cruise the year before, almost the
whole crew either died at sea, or were sent
to the hospital upon arriving at Portsmouth.
This ship, after refitting, was pretty healthy
for a little time; but, probably from
the operation of the old adhering infection,
she became extremely sickly immediately
after joining our fleet, and sent two hundred
men to the hospital the first two months
after arriving in the West Indies. Most of
these were ill of the dysentery.</p>

<p>The Pegasus frigate arrived with the ships
from Gibraltar, and we have here an instance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
of the superior health commonly enjoyed
by this class of ships over ships of
the line; for when she was dispatched to
England in the end of April, there had not
been a man taken ill from the time of her
arrival on the station.</p>

<p>This season was a very active one in the
operations of war; for, besides the general
battle of the 17th of April, there were two
partial actions in May; and, from the 15th
of the former month till the 20th of the
latter, our fleet was constantly in the face of
the enemy’s, except for a few days that it
was refitting at St. Lucia after the first battle.
This was extremely harrassing to the
men, not only from the incessant labour necessary
in the evolutions of the fleet, but by
their being constantly at quarters with the
ships clear for action; for, in that situation,
they had nothing to sleep upon but the bare
decks, the hammocks and bedding being
removed from between decks, where they
might embarrass the men in fighting, and
they become useful on the quarter deck, by
serving to barricade the ship, which is done
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
by placing them in ranges on the gunwale,
to cover the men from the enemy’s grape
and small shot. These hardships were productive
of some sickness, though much less
than might have been expected; for the
weather is at all times warm, and it was at
this time extremely moderate and dry. Besides
we shall see in other instances as well
as this, that, in the ardour inspired by the
presence of an enemy, men are less exhausted
by their exertions than on ordinary
and less interesting occasions.</p>

<p>Almost the whole of the sick and wounded,
to the number of 750, were put on
shore at Barbadoes, where all the fleet, except
three ships<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>, arrived on the 22d of
May.</p>

<p>I now began to keep regular and methodical
accounts of the sickness and mortality
in the fleet, though in a manner more imperfect
and less accurate than was afterwards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
adopted. I was embarked on board of the
Sandwich, where the Commander in Chief
had his flag, so that I was always present
with the main body of the fleet, whether at
sea or in port.</p>

<p>A form of monthly returns<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> was adopted,
which, as well as other points of method,
was afterwards improved.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>After collecting the returns for each month,
I made abstracts of them in tables; in one
column of which the complement of each
ship is set down, in order to form calculations
of the comparative prevalence and mortality
of different diseases at different times. One
of the abstracts is here inserted, (<a href="#TABLE_I">Table I</a>.)
by way of specimen, and the proportional
result of them for fourteen months is set
down in another table, (<a href="#TABLE_II">Table II</a>.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>Though this last exhibits a tolerably just
view, yet it may be remarked, as one imperfection,
that there was no distinction made
at this time in my returns between the
killed and those who died of disease; so that
in the month of May, which stands first,
the proportion is too high; for there were
sixty-four killed, and two hundred wounded,
in the two actions of that month.

<p>The main body of the fleet lay at Barbadoes
till the 6th of June, and the men had
recruited extremely by their stay there; for
vegetables, fruit, and other refreshments,
can be procured at an easier rate, and in
much greater plenty, at this island, than
any other on the station.</p>

<p>The fleet arrived at St. Lucia the next day
after it sailed from Barbadoes, and remained
there till the 18th of June. The whole
of this month was showery at this island,
though it is not accounted the common
rainy season; for more rain falls here than
at any of the other islands at that time in
our possession, being the most mountainous,
as well as the most woody and uncultivated,
of them all. These rains produced some
increase of sickness, but very little, when
compared to what took place at the same
time in the army on shore, and in the ships
refitting at the Carenage. There died about
this time from fifty to fifty-five men every
week in an army of not quite two thousand
men.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p>The difference in point of health between
the Carenage (which, as the word implies,
is the place where ships go to be hove down,
or otherwise repaired) and Gros-Islet Bay,
where the main body of the fleet lay, affords
a striking proof of the effects of situation.
The Carenage is a land-locked creek, with a
marsh adjacent to it, whereas the other is a
road open to the fine air of the sea, the only
land sheltering it to windward being a small,
dry island, consisting of one hill, of half a
league in circumference, and some of the
cliffs of the main island of St. Lucia.</p>

<p>The increase of sickness here was farther
prevented by the men having little labour
to perform on shore, nor any haunts to encourage
intemperance, a vice which the
Admiral endeavoured still more effectually
to prevent, by ordering all the rum stills in
the neighbourhood to be destroyed.</p>

<p>It may be proper here to introduce a general
account of the seasons and temperature
of the West Indies, as there will be
frequent occasion hereafter to make allusions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
to them. With regard to the heat, though
the range of the temperature is very small,
in comparison of what it is in Europe, the
variations follow the same seasons; for July
and August are the hottest months, and December
and January the coolest. This we
would naturally expect, as our plantations
lie all in the northern hemisphere, between
the 10th and 20th degree of N. latitude,
and therefore bear the same relation as Europe
does to the sun’s annual course. The
hurricanes happen in the same season in
which the periodical rains chiefly fall, that
is, in the months of August, September,
and October, which are called the hurricane
months, and this is also the most unhealthy
season. The time of the year which is most
apt to be rainy, next to this, is from the
middle of May to the middle or end of
June, but this is not invariable. The lowest
I ever observed the thermometer was at 69&deg;;
it stands very commonly at 72&deg; at sunrise,
in the cool season, rising to 78&deg; or 79&deg; in the
middle of the day. In the hot season, the
common range is from 76&deg; to 83&deg;. It seldom
exceeds this in the shade at sea; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
the greatest height at which I ever observed
it in the shade at land was 87&deg;. This is far
short of the extremes of heat which they
experience at certain seasons on the continent
of North America, even very far north.
In Pennsylvania and New York, the thermometer,
I have been assured, rises frequently
above 90&deg;. It does so commonly
enough in the East Indies; but I believe it
never was known to rise so high in the West
Indies, so that the heat, comparatively speaking,
may be called moderate and steady.</p>

<p>The comparative mortality in June is
small, owing to the fleet’s having been cleared
of all the bad cases at Barbadoes before it
sailed from thence. Though the proportion
of sick in July is less, that of the mortality
is greater, (see <a href="#TABLE_II">Table II</a>.) which seems to be
owing to this circumstance, that the cases
taken ill during the rainy weather of June
did not terminate fatally till the succeeding
month.</p>

<p>In the course of this summer the fleet
was reinforced by several ships of the line
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
from England. The Triumph arrived in
May, without any sick on board; but a flux
prevailed a few weeks afterwards, without
any evident cause, except the influence of
the climate, and the exposure and fatigues
during the operations of May. The disease,
however, soon subsided, and the ship
being kept in excellent order and discipline,
continued healthy during all the remaining
time in which she served with us.</p>

<p>In June, the Russel, of 74 guns, arrived
from North America, and the Shrewsbury,
a ship of the same rate, from England.
The former left England in 1778, but was
obliged to put back by stress of weather and
sickness, and upon arriving afterwards on the
coast of America, was extremely afflicted
both with fevers and the scurvy. These
were removed to the hospital, and this ship
had become free of all sickness before sailing
for the West Indies, except that a few of the
men were seized with fevers, and she remained
healthy after arriving there, not suffering
from any regular attack of sickness,
such as affected the ships in general from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Europe. The Shrewsbury left England
healthy, but was soon attacked with a fever
and flux, which continued to prevail till the
end of the year.</p>

<p>The fever in these two ships resembled
rather the low ship fever of Europe than
the bilious one peculiar to the climate.
This last, indeed, seldom or never prevails
to a great degree on board of a ship, unless
it has been caught on the watering duty, or
from some other exposure to the air of the
land. I have, however, known a few instances
of bilious fevers in men who never
had been on shore from the time they left
England; I have even known men of the
same description attacked with intermittent
fevers, which are supposed to depend still
more on land air. This is perhaps owing
either to the quantity of water in a great
ship, part of which is always more or less
putrid, or to the fresh-cut wood of the country
taken on board for fuel, the steam of all
which must resemble a good deal the effluvia
of woods and marshes, which are supposed
to give rise to intermittents.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>In the beginning of July our fleet was
reinforced with the Culloden, Egmont, and
Centaur, all of 74 guns. In the end of the
same month we were joined by the Alcide
and Torbay, of the same rate, and also directly
from England. The fleet was at this
time at St. Christopher’s, having arrived
there on the 22d of the month, with a large
convoy from England, which had joined it
at St. Lucia, under protection of the Thunderer
and Berwick, two ships of the line,
which being bound to Jamaica, I do not
reckon as belonging to our fleet.

<p>Account of the <span class="smcap">Health</span> of the <span class="smcap">Fleet</span> from August,
1780, till December following.&mdash;&mdash;The Fleet

<p>The hurricane months approaching, the
season for active operations in the West
Indies was now over. The whole force of
the enemy, consisting of thirty-fix French
and Spanish ships of the line, having gone
to St. Domingo in the end of July, ten sail
of the line were detached after them from
our station, for the protection of Jamaica.
The Admiral sailed for North America in
August, with eleven ships of the line, leaving
six for the protection of the islands.</p>

<p>There was little alteration in the general
state of the sick during the voyage to America,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
and indeed we found no diminution of
the West-India heat, which at this season
is at the greatest height, until we came to
the 33&deg; of N. latitude.</p>

<p>The only material alteration in point of
health was in the Alcide and Torbay, which
had arrived from England with a few men
ill of fevers; but in the course of this
voyage these two ships became as unhealthy
as any that ever came under my observation.
There was a greater number of sick on board
of them than all the fleet besides, and it
increased to such a degree, that upon their
arrival at New York, which was in the
middle of September, after a passage of three
weeks, near one half of their men were unfit
for duty. In the Alcide it was a fever that
raged; in the Torbay it was a dysentery;
and the unusual degree of sickness and mortality
which appears in the Table for the
month of September, was owing to the
very sickly state of these two ships.</p>

<p>We shall hereafter see reason for supposing
that fever and dysentery proceed from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
same cause; and as both these ships arrived
from England in a similar state with regard
to health, fevers would probably have been
the prevailing disease in both; but a part of
the 87th regiment, then serving as marines
in the fleet, was put on board of the Torbay
at St. Christopher’s, and some of them being
ill of the dysentery, gave this turn to
the disease which afterwards prevailed on
board. I have formed a Table to shew the
fluctuating state of these two diseases, and this
was one of my first and most imperfect attempts
towards a medical history of the
fleet in a methodical way. (<a href="#TABLE_III">Table III</a>.)</p>

<p>There was but little sickness in the rest
of this squadron, except in the Terrible,
where the dysentery prevailed a good deal.
None of the ships of the line which we
found in the West Indies, upon our arrival
there, were now in company, except the
Yarmouth, and this was the most healthy
of all the ships that went to North America.</p>

<p>The health of the fleet was very much recruited
by its short stay in America; for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
men were supplied with fresh meat and
spruce beer, and they enjoyed the two finest
months of the year in that temperate climate.
The squadron left New York in the
middle of November, and though dispersed
by a violent storm, all the ships arrived safe
in the West Indies before the middle of
December.</p>

<p>In October the fleet had attained such a
degree of health, that though the calculation
in the Table is made from five of the
most sickly ships, no death happened in this
month on board of any of them. In November
the mortality was also inconsiderable,
though the ships left in the West Indies are
included in the calculation; which, had it
been made upon those only that went to
North America, the deaths would have been
no more than one in seven hundred and
eleven in this month, which is rather less
than that of any other month in the Table.</p>

<p>The amendment in health, in consequence
of the change of climate, was most remarkable
in the Terrible, which, by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
time she left America, had entirely got rid
of the violent dysentery that had prevailed
for some time on board. This sudden change
in the health of this ship was evidently
owing to the great attention of the Captain
to cleanliness and discipline, and no less to
the assiduity and abilities of the Surgeon.
The Alcide still continued sickly, though
not so much so as the Torbay. The former
had sailed on a cruise in October, and having
met with very rough weather, the sick list
was thereby increased. The dysentery now
prevailed in that ship, as well as fevers, and
those men chiefly were attacked with fevers
who were ill of the scurvy, or recovering
from it. This was not very common; and
there were several other remarkable particulars
with regard to the fevers in this ship;
for her men were not only uncommonly
subject to this disease, both in America and
the West Indies, but to all the various forms
of it; the low, infectious, ship fever of Europe,
the bilious remitting, and the malignant
yellow fever of hot climates. It would
appear from this, as well as other instances,
that a ship may assume, as it were, a particular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
constitution, or a tendency to some
particular disease, for a length of time, and
this depending on some lurking and adhering
infection, or the manner in which she
may have been victualled, watered, disciplined,
or manned.</p>

<p>The great benefit derived to the health of
the fleet, from the change of climate, as
well as other reasons, justified the Admiral
in going to North America; and there was
the more merit in this measure, as it was
undertaken without precedent, and without
instruction. Upon our return we found
there was great good fortune in it, as well
as wisdom; for there had happened on the
10th of October a more violent hurricane
than any in the memory of man, and the
ravage it made both by sea and land is, perhaps,
unparallelled in history. Several of
the ships of the line were exposed to it; but
though they suffered extremely, and were
in the utmost danger, none were lost. Two
of them happened to be at Antigua, which
was out of the track of this hurricane, as
it extended only from the 12th to the 15th
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
degree of N. latitude; so that the only
islands that suffered by it were Barbadoes,
St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Martinico.&mdash;Four
frigates, and as many sloops of war,
either foundered or were wrecked, and about
one thousand seamen perished in them. One
of the buildings of the hospital at Barbadoes
was entirely demolished by the impetuosity
of the sea, which, having risen to a great
height, dashed a ship against it, and twenty-three
seamen were buried in the ruins<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>The Montague suffered most on this occasion,
and was also most subject to sickness
and mortality, brought on in consequence
of the great fatigue and hardships of the
men in bringing her into port and refitting
her; for the ship was almost torn to pieces
both in the rigging and hull, and the bedding
and other necessaries and conveniencies
were entirely destroyed. The fever that
prevailed on board at this time was of the
most malignant kind known in this climate;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
and the worst cases arose in watering, and
the other necessary duties on shore, from
which the men would sometimes return
frantic, and die in a few hours. There was
a party of soldiers on board; and as they
were not called upon to perform any duties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
on shore, they had but little sickness in companion
of the sailors.</p>

<p>The other ships having suffered less from
the storm, were also less sickly, as it was
not necessary for them to remain so long in
the unhealthy Carenage to repair.</p>

<p>The only disease that prevailed at this
time, in these two ships, was fevers, there
being few or no fluxes, though they had
been so frequent in the former part of the
year. Though fevers and fluxes depend on
the same general causes, yet when these
causes exist in a higher degree, it would appear
that they are more apt to produce
fevers. Thus the exhalations of the earth
from marshes are more apt to produce fevers;
and mere excesses of heat and cold,
or moisture, are more apt to produce fluxes;
just as in Europe a catarrh, which may be
considered as a local febrile affection, as well
as a dysentery, will be excited by exposure
to cold or damp, without any specific bad
quality in the air.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>The Ajax and Montague are the only two
ships of those left in the West Indies, which
are included in the estimate of sickness and
mortality in November and December, and
they bear a very great proportion to the
whole; for out of forty-four that died in
fourteen ships of the line in November,
twenty died in the Montague, and five in the
Ajax; and out of forty-three, the whole
number of deaths in December in twenty-one
ships of the line, ten were of the
Montague, and eleven of the Ajax.

<p>We are now come to that period in which
our fleet was reinforced with seven ships of
the line, which arrived at Barbadoes from
England on the 5th of January, 1781,
under the command of Lord Hood. This
addition, with two which had arrived in
November, made the force upon this station
again amount to twenty-one ships of the
line.</p>

<p>The whole fleet was tolerably healthy
during this month, the season being dry and
cool; there was, however, a small increase
of sickness at this time, and it was owing
to a descent made on St. Vincent’s in December.
The soldiers, (of whom there was
still a regiment on board of the fleet) the
marines, and some of the seamen, had been
on shore for one night only; but many of
them having lain on the ground, some having
been intoxicated, or having eaten to
excess of sugar-cane and fruit, caught fevers
and fluxes, which increased the proportion
of diseases and deaths the following months,
as appears by the Table.</p>

<p>I have exhibited, in another Table, a view
of the sickness and mortality of this fleet for
the five succeeding months. (<a href="#TABLE_IV">Table IV</a>.)
This account, as well as most of those that
are to follow, is confined to three diseases,
that may be called the sea epidemics. These
are, fever, flux, and scurvy.</p>

<p>The whole fleet met at Barbadoes on the
13th of January, and no service was undertaken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
till the accounts of the Dutch war
arrived on the 30th of that month. In consequence
of this intelligence, the greater
part of the ships of war went against St.
Eustatius, which was taken on the 3d of
February.</p>

<p>Ten days after this a squadron of seventeen
ships of the line was sent to cruise to
windward of Martinico, with a view to intercept
a French squadron which was then
said to be on its passage from Europe. The
cruise was there continued for six weeks;
after which small divisions of the ships were
sent to water and refit, by turns, at St.
Lucia, and were relieved by the ships left
for the protection of that island.</p>

<p>Soon after this, the whole squadron came
to leeward of Martinico; and though the
former intelligence had proved false, the
greater part of our fleet still kept the sea, in
order to block up the enemy in Fort-Royal
Bay. This they continued to do till the
29th of April, when a French fleet of
twenty-two ships of the line, from Europe,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
joined by four from Martinico, forced their
way into their own port, pushing to leeward
our fleet, consisting only of eighteen ships of
the line; so that the greater part of them did
not get into port till they came to an anchor
at Barbadoes on the 23d of May.</p>

<p>It was in this season of cruising, and
keeping the sea, that the fleet contracted
such a degree of scurvy as had never before
been known in the West Indies. This disease
is not so apt to arise in a hot climate as
in a cold one; and the prevalence of it on
this occasion was owing to the men having
been for a great length of time upon sea
victualling; for one part of the fleet had not
had a fresh meal from the time of leaving
America, that is, for six months; and that
part of it which came last from England had
been in the same circumstances for seven
months; nor had any of them been in a
place capable of supplying vegetable refreshments
from the time they left Barbadoes in
the end of January. But though no fresh
meat or vegetables could be procured at St.
Lucia or St. Eustatius, yet the scurvy did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
not make such progress in the ships that lay
at anchor there, as in those that were at sea;
and it appears that the time in which it
prevailed most was, while the greatest number
of ships was at sea, that is, in the month
of March. It appears, indeed, by the Table,
that there was a greater number ill of this
complaint on the 1st of May than on the 1st
of April; but it appears also, that more were
sent to the hospital in March than in April,
and very near half of the May list must
have been taken ill in March<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>. The difference
of being in port and at sea consists
chiefly, 1st, In there being plenty of water
while in port, so that it can be used freely,
not only to drink, but to wash the clothes;
and we know that cleanliness tends greatly
to ward off the scurvy. 2dly, Though no
fresh meat nor vegetables could be procured
at those ports, sugar, which may be considered
as a very antiscorbutic article of diet,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
could always be procured at a very cheap
rate, and the seamen, when in port, used to
exchange their salt provisions for it. 3dly,
There is at sea a dismal uniformity of life,
favourable to indolence and sadness, and
therefore tending to hasten the progress and
aggravate the symptoms of the scurvy;
whereas the change of scene and variety of
objects, when in port, tend to cheer and recreate
the mind, and thereby to avert this
disease.</p>

<p>The squadron that came from England
under Lord Hood, suffered, upon the whole,
much less from acute diseases, during the
first months of their service in this climate,
than the ships that arrived with Lord Rodney,
which was probably owing, in part at
least, to the former having arrived at the
driest and coolest season of the year. The
Barfleur, however, had a large proportion of
all the three prevailing diseases; and large
ships are in general more subject to them
than those of a smaller rate. But of all the
ships in the fleet, the Alfred had the greatest
proportion of the three sea epidemics. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
Prince William suffered more than any other
ship in the fleet from the flux, and the
Princessa from the scurvy. In some instances,
reasons can be assigned for the prevalence
of particular diseases in particular
ships, such as accidental infection, or the
manner in which they have been victualled,
manned, or disciplined; but in many cases
the cause is so subtile or obscure as to elude
our inquiry.</p>

<p>The most healthy of the new squadron,
during this campaign, were the Belliqueux
and Panther; the former was a new ship,
and came from England with a very irregular
and ill-disciplined crew. Soon after arriving
in the climate, she was threatened with a
dysentery, which, though it spread a good
deal, did not prove severe nor mortal; but
being left at St. Eustatius on this account,
while the rest of the fleet was cruising, she
soon became very healthy, and remained so.
This is the second instance we have had
occasion to remark of a new ship being
healthy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>The Panther preserved her health by
being on small separate cruises, and frequently
in port, not being attached to the
main squadron. The Sandwich was the
only other ship not engaged in the long
cruise.</p>

<p>Of the ships lately from England, that
were employed in this cruise, the Gibraltar
seems to have been the least sickly. This
ship left England healthy; but having received
a draft of dirty men when upon the
eve of sailing, a fever of the infectious kind
broke out on the passage, so that she arrived
in the West Indies in a sickly state. This
fever disappeared very soon after; and it is
proved by this, as well as other facts, that
a warm climate, so far from tending to generate,
or even to foster the infection of
fever, tends rather to extinguish it. The
Gibraltar had been put under excellent discipline
by her former commander, while in
the Channel service; and this being afterwards
kept up, the men were always clean
and regular. This was the Spanish Admiral’s
ship, taken by the fleet under the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
command of Lord Rodney off Cape St.
Vincent’s, in January 1780. She was then
called the Phœnix, and was of a singular
excellence both with respect to materials
and construction. Whether the cedar, of
which a great part of her timbers consisted,
contributed to the healthiness, by its balsamic
effluvia, I will not pretend to determine.</p>

<p>The Invincible was also uncommonly
healthy during this cruise, which may likewise
be ascribed to good discipline, and to
her having been more than three years in
commission before sailing from England,
whereby the men were brought into order,
and accustomed to each other and to a sea
life. This ship was almost singular in having
no acute diseases for several months
after arriving from Europe; but at length
paid the tribute to the climate in May and
June, as may be seen in the Table.</p>

<p>From the account of the three frigates
at the bottom of the list in the Table, it
appears how much more healthy they are
than ships of the line. The total complements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
of the three is exactly equal to that
of one seventy-four-gun ship; but their
whole sickness and mortality is less than
that of any one ship of the line of that class,
although the Triton was uncommonly sickly
for a frigate.</p>

<p>There seem to be several causes for the
superior degree of health usually enjoyed
by this smaller class of ships. There is less
chance of mixtures of men in frigates, as
their complement is smaller, and it is more
easy for the captain and officers to keep an
eye over a few men than a great number;
for, in a great ship, there are generally men,
who, concealing themselves in the most retired
parts, no one takes cognizance of
them, and they destroy themselves, and
infect others, by their laziness and filth.
In the next place, there is a greater proportion
of volunteers and real seamen in frigates,
and more landmen and pressed men
in ships of the line, the former being more
in request, on account of the greater chance
of prize money. Lastly, a small ship is
more easily ventilated, and the mass of foul
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
air issuing from the hold, from the victuals,
water, and other stores, as well as the effluvia
exhaling from the men’s bodies, is less than
in a large ship.</p>

<p>Many other and more minute remarks
might be made on different ships in this
season of hard service; but to do this would
be tedious, and the inspection of the Tables
may suggest observations to the reader.
There is a striking and instructive fact,
however, with regard to two ships, which
I cannot help relating. The Alcide and
Invincible, both of seventy-four guns, in
working to windward, after the action with
the French fleet, on the 29th of April, anchored
at Montserrat on the 11th of May,
in order to water. They remained there
only part of two days, and they procured
no refreshment, except a few bushels of
limes. The scurvy then prevailed to a great
degree in both ships; but between this time
and the 23d of May, when they came to an
anchor at Barbadoes, sixty men, who had
been confined with this disease, were discharged,
as fit for duty, from the sick list of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
the Invincible, and a hundred and fourteen
from that of the Alcide. These were the
only two ships that had the advantage of the
limes; and during these twelve remaining
days of the voyage the scurvy continued to
increase in all the other ships. Dr. Lind is
the first author who gives a decided preference
to lemons, limes, and oranges, over every
other antiscorbutic; and the above-mentioned
fact proves as demonstrably as possible the infinite
advantage of this species of acid in
scurvy.</p>

<p>The fleet was supplied with essence of
malt during all this campaign; and though
it was, no doubt, of service, it was far from
having that powerful and manifest effect
that the acid fruits had, and certainly did
by no means prevent the scurvy in all cases.
I have strong testimonies, however, of its
beneficial effects from the surgeons of several
of the ships, particularly of the Gibraltar,
Centaur, Torbay, and Alcide, in all of which
it was found either to cure the scurvy in its
first beginning, to retard its progress, or to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
mend the appearance of scorbutic ulcers, and
dispose them to heal.</p>

<p>I had conceived that melasses, being a
vegetable sweet, must have been a very
powerful antiscorbutic; but the greatest part
of the last reinforcement of seven ships
came from England furnished with this as
an article of victualling, as a substitute for a
certain proportion of oatmeal, which was
withheld agreeably to a late very judicious
order of the Admiralty. But though I am
persuaded that this article of diet mitigated
the disease, it was very far from preventing
it; and the Princessa in particular, which
suffered most from the scurvy, was well
supplied with it.</p>

<p>There is reason to think that it is not in
the vegetable sweet alone that the antiscorbutic
principle resides, but in this in conjunction
with the natural mucilage, such as
exists in the malt. I suspect likewise that
the change which the essence undergoes in
its preparation tends also to rob it of some
of its original virtue. But the melasses are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
still farther altered by being deprived of the
natural mucilage by means of quick lime,
with which all sugar is clarified in the boilers.
Dr. Hendy, of Barbadoes, to whom I have
been obliged for several remarks, informed
me, that the liquor, before it undergoes this
operation, has been found by him to produce
the most salutary effects in the scurvy; but
as this cannot be had at sea, we had no opportunity
of comparing it with other antiscorbutics.
It is certain also that the medical
effects of the native sweet juices are,
in other respects, very different from what
they are in their refined state; for manna,
wort, and the native juice of the sugar cane,
are purgative; whereas sugar itself is not at
all so<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>. This affords a presumption, that they
may be also different in their antiscorbutic
quality; and there is reason to think, from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
experience, that the more natural the state in
which any vegetable is, the greater is its
antiscorbutic quality. Vegetables, in the
form of sallads, are more powerful than
when prepared by fire; and I know, for
certain, that the rob of lemons and oranges
is not to be compared to the fresh fruit.
Raw potatoes have been used with advantage
in the fleet, particularly by Mr. Smith, of
the Triton, who made the scorbutic men eat
them, sliced with vinegar, with great benefit.
This accords also with what Dr.
Mertans, of Vienna, has lately communicated
to the Royal Society of London.</p>

<p>When the fleet arrived at Barbadoes on
the 23d of May, it was found that the number
of sick on board amounted to sixteen hundred,
and that there was not accommodation for
more than two hundred at the hospital. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
there was hardly any complaint but scurvy,
the Admiral, at my representation, issued an
order for serving the sick on board of their
own ships with fruit and other vegetables
and refreshments, such as milk and soft
bread. This course of diet commenced in
the beginning of June; and as the greater
part of the fleet was near four weeks thereafter
in port, they enjoyed the advantages of
it during that time; and the very great diminution
of sickness and mortality, which
appears by the Tables in that month, sufficiently
evinces the benefit derived from it.
In less than four weeks the fleet, from being
very sickly, became extremely healthy.</p>

<p>It was remarked, that the men recovered
faster on board than on shore; and it would
appear that land air, merely as such, has no
share in the cure of the scurvy, and that the
benefit arises from the concomitant diet,
cleanliness, and recreation. The expedient
of curing men on board of their ships was
here suggested by necessity; but it succeeded
so well, that it was adopted afterwards in
preference to an hospital, which is indeed a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
useful relief to a fleet where there are contagious,
acute disorders; but with regard to
scurvy, I am convinced, that on foreign stations,
at least, where the accommodations of
the sick are more indifferent than in England,
many advantages would arise from supplying
men with refreshments on board of their
ships. It appears that only four men died of
this disease in the whole fleet in the month
of June, though there were so many ill of
it; whereas it appears by the books of hospitals,
that scorbutic men die there in a
much greater proportion, and chiefly in consequence
of other diseases, particularly the
flux, which they catch by infection, or bring
on by intemperance. It is farther in favour
of this scheme, that great numbers of those
sent on shore are lost by desertion. It is also
a great saving to Government, the expence
not being a fourth part of what it would
cost at an hospital.</p>

<p>The fleet left Barbadoes on the 10th and
12th of July, and continued healthy till the
greater part of it sailed for North America
in the beginning of August.

<p>When the main body of the fleet went
to America in August, Lord Rodney went to
England for the recovery of his health.&mdash;Wishing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
to lay before the public boards several
reforms that suggested themselves to
me in the course of the late service, I accompanied
the Admiral, purposing to return
when the season for hostile operations should
have brought back the fleet from the coast
of America.</p>

<p>Soon after arriving in England, I presented
a memorial<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> to the Board of Admiralty,
proposing such means for the preservation of
the health of the fleet as had occurred to
me during my past service.</p>

<p>The Board of Admiralty considered this
memorial with all the attention that could
be expected in the general hurry of service,
inseparable from a great and extensive war;
and I am happy in being able to say, that,
in consequence of my application, most of
the particulars recommended have since been
so far carried into effect as to produce a
practical conviction of their utility.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>Lord Rodney having recovered his health,
hurried out to his station with all the force
that could then be equipped, as the enemy
were expected at the Caribbee Islands, with
a superior force, after their successes against
us in the autumn campaign in America.</p>

<p>I had again the honour to accompany the
Admiral. He first sailed from Portsmouth,
with four ships of the line, on the 14th of
December, and was to have been joined by
two more that lay ready at Plymouth; but
by the time we arrived off this harbour the
wind became contrary, whereby we were
detained there till the 14th of January,
1782. During this time more ships were
got ready, and six were added to the squadron;
for the public anxiety at that time
called forth every exertion to strengthen this
reinforcement, upon which the fate of the
whole West Indies was supposed to depend.</p>

<p>This fleet cleared the Channel in the midst
of a storm, and with the wind at the same
time so scanty, that we barely weathered
Ushant; but Lord Rodney’s perseverance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
and resolution, stimulated by the exigency
of the occasion, banished all hesitation and
timidity. The rough weather, and contrary
winds, continued through the variable latitudes;
but having met with fresh blowing
trade winds, common at that season, we
had the good fortune to get safe to Barbadoes
with the whole squadron on the 19th of
February.</p>

<p>All the twelve ships<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> of this reinforcement
had been on service for a considerable
length of time since they had been last commissioned,
except the Anson, a new ship,
which had never before been at sea, and the
Fame and Yarmouth, which had lately undergone
a thorough repair, since which time
they had been only for a few weeks at sea in
the Channel before they were ordered on this
expedition.</p>

<p>The only ship that was sickly when we
left England was the Fame, on board of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
which some pressed men, with the infection
about them, had been received from the
Conquestadore guardship; and the fever
which broke out in Plymouth Sound, where
I was first sent for to visit that ship, was
probably owing to the infection which these
men brought with them. The other ships
were, upon the whole, healthy; for it appeared
by the weekly accounts delivered to
the Admiral, that the mortality, including
even that of the Fame, for the four weeks
before we sailed, had been only one in thirteen
hundred, and that there had been about
one in twenty-nine on the sick list.</p>

<p>An opportunity offered on this occasion of
comparing the health of ships of war in
England with that in the West Indies.
The health of the fleet in general at home
was at this time about the proportion above
mentioned; but it is to be remarked, that it
was healthier then than in the former part of
the war.</p>

<p>Plymouth hospital, which is calculated
for twelve hundred men, was not half full;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
and there were not at this time more than
six hundred men at that of Haslar, which is
calculated to contain two thousand; but the
latter was generally full during the first two
or three years of the war, from the great
fleets that put into Portsmouth. At one
time part of the sick were even obliged to
be accommodated with tents in the neighbourhood
of the hospital, for want of room.
But towards the end of the year 1781 the
infectious fever, which constitutes a great
part of the sickness in the European seas,
was almost extirpated, and in a cruise of
five weeks in the north part of the Bay of
Biscay, under Admiral Darby, in September
and October of this year, only six men were
buried in that time from twenty-eight ships
of the line.</p>

<p>This was chiefly owing, as I apprehend,
to the length of time which the war had
continued, in consequence of which the
men of the respective ship’s companies had
been accustomed to each other, and habituated
to the mode of life peculiar to a man
of war, regulating themselves according to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
certain rules of good order and cleanliness.
The causes of the fever above mentioned,
as shall be more fully illustrated hereafter,
are chiefly connected with the circumstances
occurring in the beginning of a war, when
men of all descriptions are mixed, without
proper precautions being taken to guard
against the infection imported from jails or
guardships. The sickness in the French
fleet was still greater in the beginning of
the war than in the British; and this has
been the case in all the wars of this century.
In the fleet commanded by the Comte d’Orvilliers,
in 1779, the sickness was so great
as to disable many of the ships from service,
and great numbers of men were landed at
Brest, with a fever so malignant as to infect
the inhabitants of the town and country
adjacent. I believe, besides, that the general
health prevailing at this time in the fleet in
England, was, in part, owing to the sour
crout and melasses, which were now supplied
more amply than had ever been done before.
The entire exemption from scurvy in particular
is to be ascribed to these improvements
in diet.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>There is a tendency in acute diseases to
wear themselves out, both in individuals
that labour under them, and when the infection
is introduced into a community.
Unless there was such a <i>vis medicatrix</i>, there
could be no end to the fatality of these
distempers; for the infectious matter would
go on multiplying itself without end, and
would necessarily destroy every person who
might be actually attacked, and would infect
every person who might be exposed to it.
But animal nature is so constituted, that this
poison, after exciting a certain set of motions
in the body, loses its effect, and recovery
takes place; and those who happen
not to be infected at first, become in some
measure callous to its impression, by being
habitually exposed to it. There is, therefore,
a natural proneness to recovery, as
well with regard to that indisposition which
takes place among a set of men living together,
as with regard to a single individual
who actually labours under the disease.
Thus the most prevailing period of sickness
is when men are new to their situation and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
to each other, so that time of itself may
prove the means of prevention as well as
of cure.</p>

<p>This consideration, however, ought not to
supersede any part of our attention with regard
to the scurvy, which does not become
spontaneously extinct like acute diseases.</p>

<p>During the three first weeks of this passage
from England to the West Indies, there
was wet and boisterous weather, but it had
very little effect in augmenting sickness;
and though it not only subjected the men to
fatigue, cold, and damp, but prevented the
ships from opening their lower-deck ports
till the 2d of February, between the 31st
and 32d degree of latitude, thereby producing
close air and moisture where the
men sleep, yet, in the whole squadron, from
its leaving England till this time, there were
only seven deaths, four of which were in
the Fame.</p>

<p>The only sea epidemic that made its appearance
was the infectious ship fever,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
which, in many cases, was attended with
pleuritic, rheumatic, and other inflammatory
symptoms, owing to the cold and wet, to
which the men were exposed in the variable
latitudes. The warm, dry, fresh breezes
which we had during the remainder of the
passage, were probably what prevented any
bad consequences from the former hardships,
for there died only four men from the above-mentioned
date till we arrived at Barbadoes;
and it appeared by the Admiral’s weekly
account, that the proportion of the sick
neither increased nor diminished from the
time we got into a warm climate and fine
weather till our arrival on the 19th of
February.</p>

<p>This squadron left England with several
advantages in point of victualling, which no
ships had before enjoyed. They were amply
supplied with sour crout and melasses; they
had all more or less wine, of an excellent
quality; and the Formidable had an entire
supply of it, in place of spirits, of which
none was put on board. This slip had hitherto,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
and did for some months afterwards,
enjoy an extraordinary, perhaps an unparallelled,
degree of health. What farther contributed
to the health of this ship was,
that she had been long in commission, and
most of the recruits with which the crew
had been completed were men turned over
from other ships. There was also extraordinary
medical attention paid, particularly
in watching the first beginnings of complaints.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the squadron at Barbadoes,
it was found, that, the two hostile
fleets having returned from North America
in the beginning of December, the campaign
had opened with the siege of St.
Christopher’s, which had been invested by
twenty-eight ships of the line, and a considerable
army. Our fleet, under Lord Hood,
having attempted, with great enterprise and
skill, but without success, to relieve it,
Lord Rodney made haste to join them with
the reinforcement he had brought from
England. He remained at anchor at Barbadoes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
only one night, and in a few days
came off Antigua, where he was informed
of the surrender of St. Christopher’s; and
here, on the 25th of February, he was
joined by the rest of the fleet in their return
to windward.

<p>The fleet which was found in the West
Indies consisted of all the sixteen that went
from thence to America in August, 1781,
(except the Terrible, which had been lost)
together with six ships of the line<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
American station, the St. Albans, which arrived
from England in November, and the
Russel, which had remained in the West
Indies during the hurricane months. They
were all extremely healthy, having only
one man in twenty-eight on the sick list,
and very few had been sent to hospitals.</p>

<p>This fleet, after arriving from America,
had lain at anchor for three weeks at Barbadoes,
where it had the advantage of the
vegetable refreshments which that island
affords; but during three weeks that it lay
at anchor, in the face of the enemy, at St.
Christopher’s, the men were excluded from
all communication with the shore, and had
no vegetable food, except some yams, with
which they were supplied from Antigua, in
place of biscuit, of which there was at this
time a scarcity. These ships had therefore
been in no port for six weeks, except for a
few days that they lay in the road of Antigua
refitting, and putting the sick and
wounded on shore.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>The men had also been deprived of their
natural rest, and exposed to the air during all
the time that the fleet was at anchor before
St. Christopher’s; for they had been twice
attacked by the enemy in that situation,
and were therefore under the necessity of
keeping the ships constantly clear for action;
yet no increase of sickness followed. This
might partly be owing to the eagerness and
alacrity of spirits naturally excited in such
a situation, and also to the fleet not lying
under the lee of any land, and having springs
upon their cables, so that they had all the
perflation and all the purity of air which
ships enjoy when at sea. The fumigation
which ships undergo in battle, has also
been thought to contribute to their health.</p>

<p>To whatever cause it was owing, the fleet
we found in the West Indies was at this
time healthier than that which had just come
from England; and there was but little difference
in the degree of health of the different
ships that composed it. Of those which
left the West Indies in August, and returned
in December, the only one that could be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
said to have any epidemic disease was the
Prince William, which had never got entirely
free from the dysentery that was formerly
mentioned as prevailing so much on
board of this ship last year. The disease
was kept up, by the ship never having been
cleared of the men affected with it, and by
the crew in general being ill provided with
slops<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>, a circumstance that would render
them more susceptible of whatever infection
they might be exposed to.</p>

<p>There were also some remains of the same
disease in the Intrepid, the seeds of it having
been more or less continued from the summer
of 1780, at which time it prevailed to
a most violent degree. The Alfred had a
few of all the sea epidemics, and had been
for a long time before more or less in the
same situation, from a neglect of cleanliness,
particularly of the men’s persons.</p>

<p>The only ship in which there was any
thing like an epidemic was the Canada,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
This ship, when at home, had for many
months before she sailed been in unremitting
service, and very little in port. On the passage
from England to America, in August,
1781, there broke out a severe dysentery,
to which the scorbutic habit of the men,
from being so long at sea, probably predisposed
them. Though it had abated much
in February, 1782, it was then by no means
extinct, and continued till April. The
Prince George had been in commission all
the war, and was a model of discipline and
cleanliness, and consequently of health. This
continued till the passage from America,
when, upon the first cold weather after leaving
New York, there broke out a violent
dysentery, of which sixteen men died. This
is agreeable to what Dr. Lind observes, that
the flux may be brought on by a sudden
transition, either from cold to heat, or from
heat to cold. All the men that were ill of
this disease having been sent to the hospital
at Barbadoes, and the usual attention to
cleanliness having been kept up, the disease
entirely vanished.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>All the other ships of the American station
had been more or less visited with sickness
after they left England, except the Bedford.
This was probably owing to this ship having
been longer in commission than any of the
others, that is, for four years, and all that
time under the same commander. This last
circumstance falls to the lot of few ships;
but a great advantage attends it; for the
mutual knowledge and attachment of the
captain and ship’s company is naturally
productive of regularity and good discipline,
and thereby of health.</p>

<p>The Royal Oak, Prudent, and America,
which left England with the Bedford,
though they had been afflicted with the
scurvy and other complaints soon after arriving
in America, had been quite healthy
for some time before coming to the West
Indies, and were so much so at this period,
that, though there were a few sores and
slight complaints on their sick lists, there
was not a man confined with illness, so as
properly to be called sick. The Royal Oak,
having been the flag ship of Admiral Arbuthnot,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
was manned with choice seamen,
which is a circumstance generally conducive
to health; for these being accustomed to a
sea life, are more provident, more handy
and methodical in all that relates to diet,
cloathing, and cleanliness. The scurvy,
which infected her upon first arriving in
America, was successfully treated on board
by serving to those who were ill of it a
mess, composed of soft bread, baked on
purpose, and mixed with wine and essence
of malt.</p>

<p>The Prudent, though now quite healthy,
had been sickly soon after being put into
commission in Europe, and upon first arriving
in America. She had been uncommonly
sickly, when a new ship, upon her
first voyage, which was to the East Indies,
during the peace. This remarkable degree
of sickness was probably owing to a particular
experiment that was made in preparing
the wood of which she was built. This
experiment consisted in soaking the timber
for a length of time in a strong pickle, in
order to make it less corruptible. The only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
other ship on which the trial of this was
made was the Intrepid; and it has been already
mentioned that this was an extremely
sickly ship. The effect of it upon the wood
was to cause a constant moisture and mouldiness
in the orlops and holds. In the Intrepid,
the sickness was never conquered till
a practice was followed of pumping and
bailing her with great care, and putting a
fire into the well for six hours every day,
by which means the dampness, and the
mildew produced by it, were removed and
prevented, and the ship thereby rendered
healthy.</p>

<p>The two squadrons being united, and
consisting of thirty-four ships of the line,
proceeded to St. Lucia, where they arrived
on the 1st of March.</p>

<p>I received monthly returns as formerly,
and the form of them was improved by
adding a column for the numbers taken ill
of the several diseases in the course of the
month. The returns of February are not
complete, there being none for the 1st of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
that month, as we had not then arrived;
but as the returns of the 1st of March have
relation to the preceding month, a judgement
may be formed of the sickness and
mortality of February from the following

<p>This account is abstracted from the returns
of twenty-nine ships of the line, and
two frigates.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>The diseases and deaths under the head of
“Other Complaints,” is much more numerous
in this month than usual, which is
chiefly owing to the preceding actions with
the enemy, and to the prevalence of the
small pox. Of the deaths under this head,
seventeen were in consequence of wounds,
six from small pox, one from a mortification<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
in the shoulder, and one from consumption.</p>

<p>None of the epidemics affected one part
of the squadron more than another, except
that the ships last from England had a less
proportion of the flux than the rest; and
the few cases of this disease that were in
these ships arose after their arrival in the
climate. The Conqueror and Fame, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
were the two most sickly ships, had no
complaints but fevers.</p>

<p>The fevers had now begun to take on
some of the characteristic symptoms of the
climate; the chief of which is a greater
abundance of bile. In the Repulse, two
men had the yellow colour of the skin,
which is so peculiar to the fevers of this
climate.</p>

<p>The crew of the Anson caught an infectious
fever from a guardship in England;
and when the Proth&eacute;e sailed, there was a
fever of the same kind on board; but from
the change of climate, the symptoms became
milder, and the disease disappeared
in both these ships in the course of this
month.</p>

<p>The small pox prevailed more at this
time in the fleet than I have ever known
it to do either before or since, and that
both in the squadron from England and in
that from North America. There were six
cases in the Formidable, all of which did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
well, though two were of the confluent
kind.</p>

<p>Though there needs hardly any additional
proof of the extraordinary efficacy of lemon
juice in curing the scurvy, yet it may be of
service to impress so useful a truth on the
mind by mentioning such striking proofs of
it as occurred from time to time. The Arrogant
spoke with a Portuguese vessel near
Madeira, from which some of this fruit was
procured, and the only scorbutic man on
board happening to have some of the most
desperate symptoms, such as putrid gums,
contracted hams, the calves of the leg hard
and livid, and frequent faintings, a fair opportunity
offered for trying its virtues.
The man was allowed two of them daily,
and was perfectly well in sixteen days, during
all which time the ship was at sea, so
that it was impossible to ascribe the cure to
any other cause.</p>

<p>The fleet remained at St. Lucia from the
1st till the 18th of March, completing the
water, provisions and stores, landing the sick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
at the hospital, and also watching the motions
of the enemy, who arrived about the
same time at Martinico from the siege of
St. Christopher’s. During this time we
were reinforced with the Duke, of 90 guns,
and the Warrior and Valiant, of 74 guns,
from England. On the 18th the whole
fleet, except the Invincible, which was detached
with a convoy to Jamaica, sailed on
a cruise to windward of Martinico, in quest
of a French convoy expected from Europe;
which having eluded us, and got into their
own harbour, the whole fleet returned to
St. Lucia on the 30th of March, excepting
the Prudent, which was sent to Barbadoes.</p>

<p>We found at St. Lucia the Magnificent,
of 74, and the Agamemnon, of 64 guns,
which were the last reinforcement of this
campaign, making the British fleet on this
station amount to forty ships of the line,
a much greater force than was ever before
employed on foreign service. They were
all copper bottomed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>The weather continued fine all this month,
yet there was some increase of sickness, owing
chiefly to the hardship the men underwent
in wooding and watering. In Choc
Bay, where the fleet watered, there was at
this time a higher surf than was ever remembered,
which made the operation of
watering (at all times noxious in this climate)
uncommonly toilsome and dangerous.
It was, indeed, next to impracticable; for
many longboats were staved on the beach,
by which several men had their limbs broken,
and some lost their lives, by being
crushed or drowned; but the necessity of
the service admitted of no relaxation or delay.
There was no increase of wind to account
for this surf, so that it was owing
either to something in the currents, or to
some subterraneous cause; and there had
been felt at Barbadoes and St. Lucia, about
this time, a slight shock of an earthquake<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
to which many imputed this extraordinary
surf. In other respects, there were fewer
causes of sickness than usually occur to a
fleet in port in this part of the world; for
the air of the road is remarkably pure, and
there were fewer temptations and opportunities
of intemperance than at the other
islands.</p>

<p>The monthly returns of the surgeons
were very full and complete; but as it
would be tedious to insert at length those
of every particular ship, and as the number
of ships fluctuated in different months, I
shall do no more hereafter than set down
the general results from calculation, so as
to shew the proportional prevalence of disease
and mortality in each month.

<p>The first column is formed by dividing
the whole number on board by the number
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
taken ill. The second column is formed by
first adding the number ill on board on the
first of the month to the number taken ill
during the month, subtracting from this
sum the number sent to the hospital, and
dividing the remainder by the number of
deaths.</p>

<p>The number on the sick list of twenty-eight
ships of the line, and two frigates,
on the first of this month, was eight hundred
and forty-five; the number put on the
lists in the course of the month was one
thousand eight hundred and eighty-four;
and the number sent to the hospital in the
same time was three hundred and seventy-three;
and there died on board thirty-one.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>The total mortality this month, in relation
to the whole number of men on board,
was one in six hundred and seven.</p>

<p>It almost always happens, that ships of
war are more or less short of complement,
and allowance is made for this in all the
calculations; for having had an opportunity
of inspecting the weekly accounts delivered
to the Admiral, it was always in my
power to be informed how many there were
short of the legal complement of men in
each ship.</p>

<p>It appears, from comparing the Tables of
this month with those of the preceding,
that there had been a great increase of
fevers and fluxes, particularly of the latter.
The fevers prevailed chiefly in the ships
lately from England, especially the Fame
and Conqueror. In the Duke there were a
great number ill of fevers; but this ship
not having arrived from England till after
the first of the month, is not included in
the calculation. The fluxes were most prevalent
in the ships we found on the station,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
particularly the Canada, Resolution, and
Nymph frigate. The scurvy had increased
very little, but prevailed most in the ships
we found here. The only ships of the
new squadron that had this disease to a
considerable degree, were the Conqueror
and Nonsuch. The former had indeed a
good many ill of it; but the return having
been made in an imperfect manner, this
ship is not included in the calculation.</p>

<p>But the ships that were by far the most
healthy were those that had been the longest
from England, the Ajax, Russel, Montague,
Royal Oak, and Prudent. There had been
formerly a great mortality in all these ships;
and it would appear that this uncommon
degree of health was owing, in some measure
at least, to this circumstance, that the
most weakly had been swept off by the
different distempers to which they were exposed;
so that only the more hardy and
robust had survived.</p>

<p>Under the head of “Other Complaints,”
a much smaller number were put on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
list, and still fewer died, in this than the
preceding month. This difference is owing
to the number that died of wounds last
month.</p>

<p>There died on board, in the course of
this month, thirteen of fevers, seven of
fluxes, and seven of other complaints, of
whom five died of small pox, one of asthma,
and one of wounds he received at St. Christopher’s.</p>

<p>In order to show more fully and minutely
what are the complaints incident to fleets
in this climate, I shall set down a list of
the numbers taken ill of the different diseases
and accidents during this month, extracted
from the returns of twenty-eight
ships of the line, and two frigates.</p>

<p>The number of ulcers bears here a smaller
proportion to the whole than it does in general
to the sum total of the sick list; for
being the most tedious of all complaints,
they consequently accumulate more than any
other. Thus many of the cases now set
down as slight accidents, will, in the ensuing
month, be in the state of obstinate
ulcers.</p>

<p>Most of the diseases of one hot climate
resemble those of another, so far as I know;
but there is one disease which we hear of as
being extremely prevalent all over the East
Indies, which is hardly ever met with in
the tropical regions of the West. This is
the inflammation of the liver, of which I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
remember to have seen only one well-marked
case, and it was that of a gentleman who
had been in the East Indies, and had been
subject to it there: nor do I recollect more
than one, or at most two, cases of this sort
out of several thousand cases of various diseases
that were reported to me. This is
either owing to the greater heat and dryness
of the air in the East Indies, or some other
peculiarity with which we are not acquainted<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>.</p>

<p>Every other inflammatory complaint exists
more or less, though they are much rarer
than in cold and temperate climates. The
phthisis pulmonalis is not so common as in
cold climates, but proves sooner fatal to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
most constitutions. There are certain pulmonic
complaints, particularly those of the
asthmatic kind, to which the climate of the
West Indies is remarkably favourable; but
those in which there are tubercles and ulceration
seem to be hurried faster to a fatal
termination. The climates, from the thirtieth
to the fortieth degree of latitude, seem
to be best suited to consumptive complaints.
The rheumatisms that occur in hot climates
are mostly of the chronic kind.

<p>State of Health of the Fleet in April 1782&mdash;&mdash;Battles
on the 9th and 12th&mdash;The Fleet very healthy&mdash;from
the Quality of Provisions&mdash;from the Effects of Victory&mdash;Advantages
of close Action&mdash;What Diseases
most prevalent&mdash;Extraordinary Degree of Health in
the Formidable.</p></blockquote>

<p>This month being interesting, on account
of the memorable engagements that happened
in it, the remarks shall, for this reason, be
somewhat more full and particular.</p>

<p>Three ships of the line having been sent to
protect convoys to Jamaica, and one having
been sent to protect a convoy to Barbadoes,
there remained thirty-six at St. Lucia in the
beginning of this month. By the end of the
first week their damages were repaired, their
water and provisions complete, and the sick in
a great measure recovered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>An equal force of the enemy lay over
against us at Martinico, the two powers of
Britain and France being to make this distant
quarter of the world the theatre for trying
their strength, and deciding the sovereignty
of the seas. In the view of this great event,
our commander forwarded the necessary duties
of the fleet with such zeal and diligence,
and watched the motions of the enemy with
such vigilance, that he overtook their grand
squadron a few hours after they left their own
port, and engaged them two several days,
with a success, glorious and complete.</p>

<p>Nothing had been wanting to equip this
fleet for the great and decisive exertion it was
to make. Every ship, except two, might be
said to be healthy, most of them were complete
in men, well appointed with officers,
and well found in stores and provisions.&mdash;Conformable
to this was the eagerness, the
confidence, and resolution, which led them
to success and victory.</p>

<p>After this battle, the whole fleet, with the
prizes, bore away for Jamaica, where part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
of it arrived on the last days of April, but the
greater part of it kept the sea, till after the
middle of May.</p>

<p>As this month is more than usually interesting,
the tables are given at full length,
and a column is added for the wounded.</p>

<p>The sum total, of the numbers of the men
on board of the thirty-six ships that composed
the line of battle on the 12th of April, was
21,608, and the mortality during the month,
exclusive of those who were killed or died of
wounds, was one in 862.</p>

<p>There was less sickness, and less death,
from disease in this month, than any of the
former twenty-three months, in which I
kept records of the fleet, and less than in any
subsequent month, till the fleet got to the
coast of America.</p>

<p>To account for this, it is to be observed,
that the men had not been exposed to the
noxious air of the shore in watering, as in
the preceding month: they had received

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
from England a fresh supply of provisions,
among which was sour krout, melasses, and
essence of malt, all in addition to the ordinary
articles of victualling: many of the
ships were supplied with wine, in place of
rum, and as the weather was all along dry
and fine, the men suffered the less from the
exposure and want of sleep, which are the
necessary consequences of keeping ships
clear for battle for several days and nights
together.</p>

<p>Might not this extraordinary degree of
health have also been owing, in part, to the
effects of success upon the spirits of the men?
It is related<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>, that, when the fleet under Admiral
Matthews was off Toulon, in daily expectation
for some time of engaging the combined
fleet of France and Spain, there was a
general stop put to the progress of disease,
particularly of the scurvy, from the influence
of that generous flow of spirits, with
which the prospect of battle inspires British
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
seamen. But if the mere expectation and
ardour of a battle, without any happy event,
could have such a sensible effect, what must
have been the effect of the exultation of <small>VICTORY</small>,
a victory in which the naval glory of
our country was revived and retrieved, after
a series of misfortunes and disgraces, which
had well nigh extinguished the national pride
in every department of service! The plain
and honest, though unthinking seaman, is
not less affected by this than the more enlightened
lover of his country. Even the
invalids at the hospital demonstrated their
joy, upon hearing of this victory, by hoisting
shreds of coloured cloth on their crutches.</p>

<p>It would appear, that there is something
in situations of exertion and danger, which
infuses a sort of preternatural vigour. When
the mind is interested and agitated by active
and generous affections, the body forgets its
wants and feelings, and is capable of a degree
of labour and exertion, which it could
not undergo in cold blood. The quantity
of muscular action employed in fighting at a
great gun for a few hours, is perhaps more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
that what is commonly employed in a week
in the ordinary course of life, and though
performed in the midst of heat and smoke,
and generally with the want of food and
drink, yet the powers of nature are not exhausted
nor overstrained; even the smart of
wounds is not felt; and the future health of
those who survive unhurt by external violence
is so far from being injured, that it is sometimes
mended by this violent, but salutary agitation.</p>

<p>The loss in action, and the number of mortal
wounds, were not so great as might have
been expected in a battle continued for a whole
day. This advantage was owing to the superiority
of our fire, as well as to the closeness of
the fight, of which the Commander in Chief
set the illustrious example, by penetrating
the enemy’s line with his own ship; a bold
and singular effort which first decided the event
of the day. When ships in action are
opposed to each other at a small distance, the
velocity of cannon balls is so great, that in
penetrating a ship’s side, few or no splinters
are torn off; and by these more men are commonly
killed and wounded, than by the ball
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
itself. For the same reason, a close shot does
less damage also to the ship itself, than a distant
one; for a quick-flying ball makes an
aperture less than its own diameter, whereas
a spent one produces innumerable deadly splinters,
at the same time shivering the object it
strikes, and making wide and extensive rents
in it. The proportion of the wounded to the
killed, is also greater in distant, than in close
fight, on account of the great number of
small splinters; and we have an experimental
proof of this, in comparing the action in
Fort Royal Bay in April 1781, with this
near Dominica in April 1782. In the former,
the enemy having kept far to windward,
and engaged at a great distance, the proportion
of the wounded to the killed was
considerably more than four to one<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>; whereas
in the latter, where the greater part of the
battle was close, the proportion of the
wounded to the killed, was little more than
three to one<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>Though it is a remark not belonging to a
medical work, yet it may be observed, that
the greatest advantage that arose to us from
close action was, that the fire of the enemy was
thereby silenced; for the advantages would be
mutual and equal, on the supposition, that
the French, in such a situation, were to keep
the deck, and stand to their guns equally
well with the British seamen.</p>

<p>It appears, by examining the table, that the
ships in which the fevers chiefly prevailed
this month, were those that came last from
England, and that those in which the fluxes
prevailed most were chiefly of the squadron
we found on the station, namely, the Canada,
Resolution, and Prince William. The
latter however recovered greatly in the course
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
of this month. Some of the Ships that arrived
last from England, namely, the Arrogant,
Proth&eacute;e, and Anson, were also considerably
afflicted with fluxes, but they were of an extremely
mild kind; and the small number of
deaths from this disease in comparison with
those from fevers, is a proof of a former
observation, that this is the safest form
in which an acute disease can shew itself.
This small degree of mortality was also owing
to the judicious method of treating it which
was in general practised throughout the fleet;
and it is but justice to the medical gentlemen
to say, that they shewed on this, as well as
every other occasion, great skill and attention
in the treatment of the sick and wounded.</p>

<p>The sum total of fevers and fluxes that
have been put on the list this month, is much
the same as that of the preceding month;
but the proportion of fluxes in April is much
greater.</p>

<p>The proportion of scurvy is somewhat increased;
which is not to be wondered at,
when it is considered, that though the fleet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
had not been so long at sea as is necessary to
produce it, especially in this climate, yet the
men having had no refreshments when last in
port, may be considered as having been all
that time at sea.</p>

<p>The superior degree of health in this
month will appear in a still stronger light,
if we cast our eye on the column expressing
the number sent to the hospital, the proportion
of which is, comparatively, very
small.</p>

<p>The ships that had been the longest from
England, were still among the most healthy.
But of all the fleet, none was so free from
sickness and mortality as the Formidable.
No man belonging to this ship died of disease
for the first four months after sailing from
Plymouth, though there were at times
900 men on board, and never less than the
established complement, which is 750; and
so few were taken sick in that time, that
only thirteen were sent to hospitals, and
their complaints were small-pox and ulcers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>This ship left England provided with every
thing that could be supposed to conduce to
the health of men, and may be considered
as an experiment to prove what degree of
health may be attained by proper management
and attention. She was furnished not
only with abundance of sour krout, melasses,
and essence of malt, in common with the
other ships; but what was peculiar to her,
was an entire supply of excellent wine, in
place of spirits, of which none was used
during the period mentioned.

<p>All the squadron that was left to windward
of Jamaica, consisting of twenty-four
ships of the line, kept the sea during great
part of May, the last division of it not
having come to Port Royal till the 25th of
that month.</p>

<p>The whole fleet remained in harbour
during the remainder of the month, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
whole of the next, except the Warrior,
Proth&eacute;e, and Russell; the two former were
sent on a cruise, in which the Warrior continued
quite healthy, as she had been ever
since her arrival from England; and in the
Proth&eacute;e a great check was given to the
fevers and fluxes which had begun to prevail
at Port Royal. The Russell was sent
to England with a convoy.

<p>The whole number of sick on board on
the first of this month, in thirty-six ships
of the line and two frigates, upon which
the preceding calculation is formed, was one
thousand four hundred and eighteen. The
whole number taken ill in the course of the
month was two thousand eight hundred and
twenty-eight; the number sent to the hospital
was one hundred and seventy-three;
and there died on board ninety-four.</p>

<p>The proportion of those who died this
month, in relation to the whole number on
board, was one in two hundred and eighty-seven.</p>

<p>There was a considerable increase of sickness
and mortality this month in all the
common diseases, and chiefly in that part of
the squadron which was in port. There
was less increase in the number of fevers
than either of the other two epidemics;
but such was their increased malignancy,
that more died of them than of both the
others. The number of fluxes was more
than double of what it was the preceding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
month, and the mortality from them was
also in a much greater proportion, as may
be seen from the Tables.</p>

<p>The fevers prevailed chiefly in port, and
the fluxes at sea. A good many of the latter,
indeed, arose in the Alcide, though
constantly in port; but this seemed to be
owing to contagion conveyed by some British
soldiers, who were sent on board of
this ship after being retaken in one of the
French men of war, several of whom were
ill of this disease. But there were few
fluxes in those ships at Jamaica in which
the most malignant fevers appeared. There
were a few in those in which the fevers
arose from the air of the marshes on the
watering duty; but there were none on
board of the French prizes, nor in those
ships in which that sort of fever was
which proceeded from a similar cause, that
is, filth and animal effluvia. Upon the
whole, in those ships in which the fever
was most malignant, there the fewest fluxes
were found.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>Several circumstances contributed to the
increase of sickness and mortality this
month.</p>

<p>1st. The infection, or rather the foul air,
of the French prizes, in most of which a
very bad fever broke out among the officers
and men that were sent from the ships of
our fleet to take charge of them.</p>

<p>The discipline and internal œconomy of
the French ships of war are greatly inferior to
those of the British. Their decks are never
washed, and there is a great defect in every
point of cleanliness and order. The free
course of the air is obstructed by lumber of
every kind, and by bulkheads, which are
not taken down even in the time of battle;
and the gratings are covered night and day
with tarpaulins, even in a hot climate.
There are not even scuppers opened on the
lower deck as outlets to the water and filth,
which necessarily accumulate there, and for
which the only vent is a pipe contrived on
purpose, passing from that deck along the
ship’s side into the hold, which becomes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
thereby a common sink, inconceivably putrid
and offensive. And in addition to the
ordinary causes of corruption, there was
one peculiar to the occasion; for the blood,
the mangled limbs, and even whole bodies
of men, were cast into the orlop, or hold,
and lay there putrifying for some time. The
common sailors among the French have a
superstitious aversion to the throwing of
bodies overboard immediately after they are
killed, the friends of the deceased wishing
to reserve their remains, in order to perform
a religious ceremony over them when the
hurry and danger of the day shall be over.
When, therefore, the ballast, or other contents
of the holds of these ships, came to be
stirred, and the putrid effluvia thereby let
loose, there was then a visible increase of
sickness. For the first three weeks after the
capture, the stench proceeding from the
numbers of wounded men contributed also
to taint the air.</p>

<p>The Ville de Paris was much more sickly
than the other prizes, not only from her being
larger, and thereby containing a greater
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
mass of foul air, but by receiving the surviving
part of the crew of the Santa Monica,
one of our frigates, which had been cast
away on the Virgin Islands, and whose men
were so reduced by hardship and intemperance,
that most of them were taken ill as
soon as they came to breathe the unwholesome
air of the French prize. To whatever
cause it was owing, the fever was much more
violent here than in the other prizes, and it
generally carried men off on the third or
fourth day; and what is remarkable, the
officers were affected by it in a greater proportion
than the common men. One lieutenant,
and every warrant officer, except
the boatswain, died of it. This was a proof
that the sickliness was owing to the bad air,
and not to the intemperance and irregularity
so usual on board of prizes, which only
the common men give into; and the probable
cause of the officers being most affected
is, that they were accustomed in common to
a purer air, by living in the most clean and
airy parts of the ship.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>It is also remarkable, that the Ville de
Paris was healthy when taken, and had been
so ever since leaving France in March, 1781;
nor had any other of the captured ships of
the line been sickly for some time before,
except the Ardent, when she arrived at Martinico
four months before, at which time
the greater part of the crew were sent to the
hospital with fevers. This, as well as other
facts of the same kind, tends to prove, that
when men come to be much habituated to
bad air, their health is not affected by it.</p>

<p>The French ships were purified by washing
and scraping, by fumigating daily with gunpowder
and vinegar, and by the use of wind
sails; but nothing seemed to contribute so
much to sweeten the air in them as burning
fires in the hold; for this tended both to make
the putrid matter exhale, and to carry it off,
by producing a perpetual change of air. Captain
Curgenven, who at this time commanded
the Ville de Paris, had great merit from his
very assiduous and successful endeavours in so
difficult a duty as the management and equipment
of this great ship. In consequence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
the judicious measures taken, and the men
becoming more used to the bad air, the sickness
ceased in the course of a few weeks.</p>

<p>In the accounts given in the tables, the
French prizes are not included, for the disorderly
state in which they were at this time
prevented my receiving regular returns: but
having made inquiry concerning the mortality
in the Ville de Paris, I found, that of
a crew of three hundred and twelve men,
there died ten in the month of May, and
there were thirty sent to the hospital, whose
cases were so unfavourable, that about one
half died. The only diseases were fevers.
The surgeon of the Ardent told me about
the same time, that one third of the crew
of that ship was ill of fevers.</p>

<p>The second cause of the prevalence of
sickness, while the fleet was at Jamaica,
was, the watering duty, which was carried
on at Rock-fort, about three leagues from
Port Royal. It was the practice of many
of the ships to leave the water casks on shore
all night, with men to watch them; and as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
there is a land wind in the night, which
blows over some ponds and marshes, there
were hardly any of the men employed on
that duty who were not seized with a fever
of a very bad sort, of which a great many
died. The ships that followed a different
practice were somewhat longer in watering;
but this was much more than compensated
by their preserving the health and saving the
lives of their men.</p>

<p>The land wind which blows on the shore
in the night time, is a circumstance in which
Jamaica differs from the small islands to
windward, over which the trade wind blows
without any interruption: but though this
land wind blows upon Port Royal from some
marshes at a few miles distance, it does not
seem to produce sickness, for it is a very healthy
place, and several of the ships enjoyed
as good health as in the best situations on
the windward station. The bay which forms
this harbour is bounded towards the sea by
a peninsula of a singular form, being more
than ten miles in length, and not a quarter
of a mile broad at any part. Great part of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
it is swampy and overgrown with mangroves,
and though of such small extent, we fancied
that some of the ships that lay immediately
to leeward of this part were more sickly than
those that were close to the town of Port
Royal, which stands at the very extremity of
this long peninsula upon a dry, gravelly soil.</p>

<p>The weather this month was uniformly
dry in port; but at sea the air was moist
and hazy. Between Jamaica and Hispaniola,
where part of the squadron was left to cruise,
dead calms prevailed; and this, joined to the
moisture of the air, was probably what
caused the flux to prevail chiefly in this part
of the fleet. At Port Royal, on the contrary,
there was a strong dry breeze, which
set in every day about nine o’clock in the
morning, and blew all day so fresh, that
there was frequently danger in passing from
one ship to another in boats. This is called,
in the language of the country, the <i>fiery sea
breeze</i>, an epithet which it seems to have
got not from its absolute heat, but from the
feverish feeling which it occasions by drying
up the perspiration. It was remarked, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
this breeze was stronger this season than had
ever been remembered; and it sometimes
even blew all night, preventing the land
breeze from taking its usual course. This
year was farther remarkable for the want of
the rains that were wont to fall in the
months of May and June. We shall have
occasion to remark hereafter, that this was
a very uncommon season also in Europe and
America. The heat, by the thermometer,
this month, on board of a ship at Port Royal,
was, in general, when lowest in the night,
at 77&deg;, and when highest in the day, in the
shade, at 83&deg;.</p>

<p>There was a considerable increase of scurvy
in this month, compared with the former
months of this campaign; but very inconsiderable,
compared with what had occurred
in cruises of the same length in former years.
The last division of the fleet had been at sea
seven weeks, all but one day, when it arrived
at Port Royal; and though the scurvy had
appeared in several of the ships, it did not
prevail in any of them to a great degree,
except in the Nonsuch. Out of fourteen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
deaths which happened in the whole fleet
from this disease, in May, seven of them
were in this ship, and several were sent from
her to the hospital in the last and most desperate
stage of it. But, upon the whole, the
cases of the true sea scurvy in the fleet, in
general, were few and slight, and a great
many of those given in the reports under the
head of scurvy, were cutaneous eruptions or
ulcers, not properly to be classed with it.</p>

<p>The cruise in the preceding year to windward
of Martinico, may be compared with
that in May of this year; for the fleet in
both cases had been at sea about the same
length of time. But the comparison is very
greatly in favour of the latter, which is most
probably to be imputed to the plentiful supply
of melasses, wine, sour krout, and essence
of malt. But no adequate reason that I
could discover can be assigned for the prevalence
of it in the Nonsuch to a degree so
much more violent than in the other ships;
and it was here farther remarkable, that it
attacked every description of men indiscriminately;
for I was assured by the officers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
and by the surgeon, that not only the helpless
and dispirited landsman was affected, but
old seamen, who had never before suffered
from it on the longest cruises. I have been
led by this, and some other facts, to suspect
that there may be something contagious in
this disease.</p>

<h4>JUNE.</h4>

<p>The greater part of the fleet remained at
Jamaica during this month, refitting and
watering. Twelve ships of the line were
sent to sea on the 17th, under the command
of Rear-admiral Drake, but not being able
to get to windward on account of the fresh
breezes that prevailed, they returned to Port
Royal on the 28th. Such of these ships as
were sickly, became more healthy while at
sea; but some bad fevers arose, particularly
in the Princessa; and it is a curious circumstance,
that these fevers attacked only those
men who had been on shore on the watering
duty; from which it would appear, that
something caught or imbibed, which is the
cause of the fever, lies inactive for some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
time in the constitution, some of the men
not having been affected for more than a
week after they had been at sea.</p>

<p>The weather continued dry and windy, as
in the former month; but the heat was in
general about two degrees higher, the thermometer
varying from 79&deg; to 84&frac12;&deg;.</p>

<p>The proportion of deaths in relation to the
whole numbers on board, was one in one
hundred and thirty-eight.</p>

<p>There was only one in thirty of the sick
sent to the hospital in the course of this
month.</p>
</div>

<p>There was an increase both in the numbers
and fatality of fevers. This increase
was chiefly in that sort of fever which depends
on the air and climate, the greater
part of which was caught on the watering
duty. There was a diminution of those
fevers depending on infection, and the foul
air of ships, which arose in the French
prizes. The care that was taken in purifying
these ships was very effectual; for only
four died this month in the Ville de Paris,
and fewer also were sent to the hospital than
in May. The increase of the other kind of
fever was chiefly owing to there being a
greater number of ships in port, the crews
of which were employed in watering, and
partly, no doubt, to the increase of heat in
the weather. The ships in which the fevers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
were most fatal were the Monarch, the
Duke, the Torbay, and the Resolution.
The sickness in the Duke was still in a
great measure owing to the same infection
that had hitherto prevailed; for this ship
had never been cleared of the infectious
fever, for want of room at the hospital.
That which broke out in the Torbay was
also of the low infectious kind, few of them
having the symptoms of that which is peculiar
to the climate, which prevailed in the
other ships. This ship, though formerly
very subject to infectious complaints, had
been remarkably healthy for some time past;
but it would appear that there was a large
stock of latent infection, which shewed itself
from time to time.</p>

<p>Some ships, particularly the Montague
and Royal Oak, had no increase of fevers
or other complaints, though the one lay in
port for seven, and the other for eleven
weeks, and were more or less exposed to the
causes of sickness which affected the rest of
the fleet. This is a proof, among many
others, that a particular combination of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
causes is necessary to produce a disease: no
single one, however powerful, being sufficient,
without the concurrence of others.
What seemed to be wanting here was the
predisposition requisite for the admission of
disease into the constitution; for the ships
that enjoyed this happy exemption were
such as had long-established and well-regulated
crews, accustomed to the service and
climate.</p>

<p>There had been this month a diminution
both of the numbers and mortality of fluxes,
which is agreeable to what was before remarked,
that fevers were more apt than
fluxes to prevail in the bad air of a harbour<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>.
It was also before remarked, that there were
few or no fluxes in those ships in which the
fever was most malignant; and now that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
fever began to grow more mild in the French
prizes, the flux began to appear. In the
Barfleur, Duke, and Namur, both diseases
seemed to prevail equally; but the fevers,
though numerous, were more of the low
nervous kind than bilious or malignant;
and the fluxes chiefly attacked those who
were recovering from fevers. We may farther
remark, that these three men of war
were three-decked ships, of 90 guns, the
crews of which being more numerous, and
composed of a more mixed set of men,
were consequently subject to a greater chance
of infection, and a greater variety of complaints.
The Formidable still remained healthy
to an extraordinary degree. Some fevers
were indeed imported from the Ville de
Paris by men that had been lent to that ship,
and who were taken ill after their return.
Of these, a few of the worst cases were sent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
to the hospital, and two died on board, who,
with one that died the preceding month,
make the whole mortality of this ship,
since leaving England, amount only to the
loss of three men.</p>

<p>There has been little or no increase of
scurvy this month; for though the numbers
put on the list appear to be greater, the
mortality is much less. It may indeed appear
a matter of surprise that there should
have been any scurvy at all, considering
that the greater part of the fleet was at anchor
all this month. But as this was the
greatest fleet that had ever visited Jamaica,
it was impossible to find fresh provisions for
the whole; and the small supply they had
did not amount to one fresh meal in a week.
Port Royal is also remote from the cultivated
part of the island, so that fruit and vegetables
were both scarce and high priced,
particularly this year, on account of the
usual rains in May and June having failed.
There was, however, an allowance of fresh
provisions and vegetables made to the sick
by public bounty; for as the hospital could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
contain but a small proportion of the sick
and wounded, an order was given for the
supply of fresh meat, fruit, and vegetables,
to the sick, and five hundred pounds of Peruvian
bark were also distributed as a public
gratuity, besides sugar, coffee, and wine.</p>

<p>With these aids, and the various good articles
of victualling from England, the fleet
was preserved uncommonly healthy for a
West-India campaign: for though the mortality
had increased considerably during our
stay at Jamaica, yet the loss of men, upon
the whole, was small, compared with that
of other great fleets in this climate on former
occasions. The greatest squadron, next
to this, that had ever been on this station
was that under Admiral Vernon in the year
1741, at the same season. From this fleet
upwards of eleven thousand men were sent
to the hospital in the course of that and the
preceding year, of whom there died one
in seven, besides what died on board of
their own ships and in two hospital ships<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
The disproportion of sickness in the two
fleets will appear still greater, when it is
considered that Admiral Vernon’s contained
only fifteen thousand seamen and marines<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>;
whereas that under Lord Rodney contained
twenty-two thousand. What added to the
sickness of the former was the unfortunate
expedition to Carthagena in April, 1741;
to which probably it was owing that a much
greater proportion of yellow fevers were
landed from the fleet at that time than from
ours, as appears by the papers left by Mr.
Hume, who was then surgeon of the hospital.
The hospital was then at a place called
Greenwich, on the side of the bay opposite
to Port Royal, and was very large; but it
was found to be in a situation so extremely
unhealthy, that it was soon after abandoned
and demolished, and the hospital has since
been at Port Royal.</p>

<p>It appears by the tables, that a greater
number was put on the list under the head of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
<i>other complaints</i> in this month than the last.
This was owing to the great number of
ulcers which I have remarked to keep pace
with feverish as well as scorbutic complaints;
for when the constitution of the air is favourable
to disease, or the habit of body
prone to it, wounds and sores are found
then to be more difficult of cure. There
were twelve deaths besides those occasioned
by what have been called the three epidemics.
Of these, five perished by drowning
and other accidents, three died of ulcers,
one of wounds received in action, one of
<i>cholera morbus</i>, and one of an abscess.</p>

<p>It has appeared that very few ships of
this numerous fleet preserved their health
while lying at anchor; and it would seem
that short and frequent cruises are very conducive
to health. It was eleven weeks from
the time that the first of our fleet came to
anchor at Jamaica till the main body of it
sailed for America on the 17th of July.
Great fleets are in time of war under the
necessity of being at one time longer at sea,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
and at another time longer in port, than is
consistent with the health of the men, the
ships being obliged to act in concert and to
co-operate with each other. This is one
reason, among others, for ships of the line
being more sickly than frigates. As ships
of war must be guided by the unavoidable
exigencies of service, it would be absurd to
consider health only; but if this were to be
the sole object of attention, a certain salutary
medium could be pointed out in dividing
the time between cruising and being in
harbour; and it is proper that this should be
known, that regard may be had to it, as far
as may be consistent with the service. I
would say, then, that in a cold climate men
ought not to be more than six weeks at sea
at one time, and need not be less than five
weeks, and that a fourth part of their time
spent in port would be sufficient to replenish
their bodies with wholesome juices. In a
warm climate men may be at sea a considerable
time longer, without contracting scurvy,
provided they have been under a course
of fresh and vegetable diet when in port.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>Though contagion is not so apt either to
arise or to spread in this climate as in colder
ones, there were several circumstances about
this time tending to prove that it may
exist in a hot climate. Those ships which
had their men returned to them from the
French prizes, in all of which fevers prevailed,
had an increase of sickness not only
in the men that were returned, but in the
rest of the crew. There was another presumption
of contagion, from the proportion
of mortality among the surgeons and
their mates, who were by their duty more
exposed to the breath, effluvia, and contact
of the sick. There died, during our stay
at Jamaica, three of the former, and four
of the latter, which is a greater proportion
than what died of any other class of officers
or men.</p>

<p>It has been the opinion of some, that fevers
do not arise from any putrid <i>effluvia</i>,
except those of the living human body, or
some specific infection generated by it while
under the influence of disease. It has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
alledged in proof of this, that the putrid
air in some great cities is breathed without
any bad effects; and a celebrated professor of
anatomy<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> used to observe, that those employed
in dissecting dead bodies did not
catch acute diseases more readily than other
people. I believe this may be true, in a
climate like Europe, where cold invigorates
the body, and enables it to resist the effects
of foul air; but I am persuaded it is otherwise
in tropical climates. The external
heat of the air induces great languor and
relaxation, and we cannot breathe the same
portion of air for the same length of time
in a hot as in a cold climate, without great
uneasiness. The want of coolness must,
therefore, be compensated by a more frequent
change of air, and by its greater purity:
any foulness of the air is accordingly
more felt in a hot climate; and, according
to the modern theory, air, already loaded
with putrid phlogistic vapour, will be less
qualified to absorb the same sort of vapour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
from the blood in the lungs, in which, according
to this theory, the use of respiration
consists. Be this as it will, there is
something in purity of air which invigorates
the circulation, and refreshes the body; and
the contrary state of it depresses and debilitates,
particularly in a hot climate; and in
this way foul air may induce disease, like
any other debilitating cause, independent of
infection, or any specific quality. There
was no reason to suspect any such infection
in the Ville de Paris; for there was no
sickness on board of this ship when in possession
of the enemy, and the sickness that
prevailed after her being captured seemed to
proceed from what may be called simple putrefaction.
There was an instance of the
same kind in one of our own ships of the
line, in which a bad fever broke out in the
beginning of July, which seemed to be owing
to the foul air of a neglected hold; for
there was a putrid stench proceeding from
the pumps, which pervaded the whole ship.
I perceived this very sensibly one day, when
visiting some officers who were ill of fevers;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
and before I left the ship an alarm was given
of two men being suffocated in what is called
the <i>well</i>, which is the lowest accessible part
of the hold. This fever was of a very malignant
kind, and fell upon the officers more
than the men; for six of them were seized
with it, of whom three died on the third
day after being taken ill.</p>

<p>The fevers, which were of the greatest
malignity at this time, affected the officers
more than the common men. Only one
captain died at Jamaica while the fleet was
there, and it was of this fever. We lost
five lieutenants, of whom four died of it;
and this was the disease which carried off
the three surgeons. But foul air was not
the only cause that produced this fever
among the officers, several of whom brought
it on by hard drinking, or fatiguing themselves
by riding or walking in the heat of
the sun. It cannot be too much inculcated
to those who visit tropical countries, that
exercise in the sun, and intemperance, are
most pernicious and fatal practices, and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
it is in general by the one or the other
that the better sort of people, particularly
those newly arrived from Europe, shorten
their lives.</p>

<p>The season of the hurricanes approaching,
and all the convoys destined for England
this year being dispatched, the main
body of the fleet, consisting of twenty-four
ships of the line, left Port Royal on the
17th of July, under the command of Admiral
Pigot, in order to proceed to the coast
of America. A great convoy for England
had been sent off a few days before, protected
by the Ville de Paris and six other
ships of the line, which we overtook and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
passed at the west end of the island. When
we arrived off the Havannah, a large squadron
of the enemy was seen there in readiness
to sail, which induced the Admiral to
wait in sight of it for the convoy, which
did not come up till ten days after. Owing
to this delay, and our meeting with baffling
winds on the rest of the passage, we did not
arrive at New York till the 7th of September.
We found there the Invincible and
Warrior, which sailed after us, but arrived
before us, by having taken the windward
passage.

<p>The mortality this month, in relation to
the whole numbers on board, was one in
a hundred and thirty.</p>

<p>There were only one in thirty-eight of
the sick sent to the hospitals.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>
</div>

<p>The fevers arose chiefly during the first
two weeks after leaving Jamaica, which
renders it probable that the seeds of them
were brought from thence. Had they been
owing to the heat simply, they would
have been as apt to arise in some subsequent
part of the passage; for the tropical
heats at this season of the year extend to
the 30th degree of latitude, which we did
not cross till the 22d of August, that is,
near five weeks after leaving Jamaica. The
only ships in which the fever could be imputed
to infection or foul air were the Barfleur,
Alcide, and the Aimable frigate. The
first had received, as recruits, at Jamaica,
men who had been confined for some time
before in a French jail, and a fever of a
bad kind spread on board of her soon after.
The Aimable was a prize from the French;
and the sickness was here so evidently owing
to foul air, that, whenever the contents
of the hold were stirred, so as to let
loose the putrid effluvia, there was then an
evident increase of sickness. The fever in
the Alcide was of a peculiar slow kind, to
be described hereafter, and seemed to be a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
continuation of the same infection which
had so long existed in that ship.</p>

<p>The Duke, which had hitherto been by
far the most subject to fevers of any ship
in the fleet, became more and more free
from them even in the most early part of
this passage, and might be said to be entirely
so at the time she arrived in America.
The fever had been so very prevalent in
this ship since leaving England, that there
was hardly a man who had escaped it.
Could this have any effect in making them
less liable to catch it a second time?</p>

<p>In the course of this passage the dysenteries
came to prevail over the fevers, as we
have found to be commonly the case at sea.
It appears by the former table, compared
with the next, that the mortality in fevers
was much the same, and that in the dysentery
it was greater than while the fleet
was at Jamaica. This does not argue, however,
that the diseases were equally malignant,
but was owing to the want of an hospital,
and of those comforts of diet which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
the sick enjoyed on board while in harbour.
This last was particularly felt in the dysenteries,
in the cure of which more depends
upon diet than in most other diseases. In
all the calculations of mortality on board of
ships, if any have been sent to the hospital,
they are to be deducted from the number;
and these make a greater difference in the
mortality on board than their numbers simply
would indicate; for only the worst
cases, and those therefore who were most
likely to die, used to be sent to the hospital.
But as the fleet was at sea during the whole
of this month, no allowance of this kind is
to be made.

<p>The mortality this month, in relation to
the whole numbers on board, was one in
one hundred and sixty-nine.</p>
</div>

<p>The scurvy began to appear very soon
upon this passage; for by the end of August,
at which time the fleet had only been
six weeks at sea, and that in a warm climate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
and in dry weather, it had made considerable
progress. It first appeared and
prevailed most in the Prince George and
Royal Oak, though they had been ten
weeks at Jamaica. This was the first sickness
with which the latter had been affected
since arriving in the West Indies; and there
was no perceivable peculiarity in either of
them to account for their being subject to it
more early, or more violently, than the rest
of the fleet. If the disease is contagious,
as has been suspected, there might be a few
men on board of them, who, being uncommonly
prone to the disease, would be soon
affected, and communicate it, or at least
hasten the symptoms in those who might be
less predisposed to it. But this is only conjecture.
Before the end of the voyage, the
whole fleet was more or less afflicted with it,
though it had been only seven weeks and
three days at sea; but the men had received
so few refreshments while in port, that their
constitutions were prepared to fall into this
disease. The Barfleur, Alfred, and Princessa,
were most affected with it next to the two
ships mentioned above.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>The seventeen ships which arrived from
England in February and March were much
less affected with it than the rest of the
fleet, which was, no doubt, owing to the
wine, melasses, and sour krout, with which
they were so amply supplied. Though these
articles were all expended before leaving Jamaica,
yet the good effects of them on the
constitutions of the men were visible in the
course of this passage.</p>

<p>The America was the most free from it of
all the ships of the old squadron; and this
was owing to the great humanity and attention
of the captain<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>, who, as soon as any
of the men were taken ill, allowed them
wine and other refreshments from his private
store. There was another proof in the Conqueror
of the great importance of attending
to this disease in its earliest stage. Mr.
Lucas, the surgeon of this ship, by watching
the first beginnings of it, by a proper
regulation of diet, and the administration of
the essence of malt and juice of limes, not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
only prevented the progress of the disease,
but proved, that, with great attention, it
may even be cured at sea. It is of the utmost
consequence in this disease to put the men
on the sick list on the very first appearance of
the symptoms, so that they may early have
the advantage of proper treatment and regimen.
It is only at this period of it that the
effects of essence of malt are sensible; but
we have seen that the juice of certain fruits
will cure it in more advanced stages.</p>

<p>There is a very important remark suggested
by comparing the two preceding tables
with that which follows. It appears
that in the month of September a much
greater number was taken ill of scurvy, and
also that there died of this disease a greater
proportion than in the two preceding months.
All the mischief from it in that month happened
in the first week of it, during which as
many died as in the whole month of August;
for the fleet came to an anchor on the 7th of
September at New York, where the worst
cases were immediately sent to the hospital,
and those that remained on board were supplied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
with every necessary refreshment. Had
the fleet remained longer at sea, the mortality
would probably have increased in the
same progression; and this circumstance
ought to be well considered in undertaking
cruises.</p>

<p>The proportion of deaths, in relation to
the whole numbers on board, was one in
three hundred and ninety-eight.</p>

<p>About one third of all the sick were sent
to the hospital.</p>
</div>

<p>As the proportion of ulcers was uncommonly
great, I thought it worth while to
make a calculation of it. The Barfleur had
the greatest number; and this ship, for
causes I cannot assign, was more afflicted
with bad ulcers than any other in the fleet,
for several months together.</p>

<p>The fleet having arrived at New York in
this unhealthy state, the first care was to
make provision for the sick. There were
somewhat more than fifteen hundred on the
sick lists of all the ships, and the hospital
could accommodate little more than six hundred.
In order that it might not be overcrowded,
and that each ship might have a
just share of relief, I went round the fleet to
ascertain the due proportion of those cases
that were the most proper objects for being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
sent on shore. All the infectious and acute
Complaints, and some of the worst scorbutics,
were accordingly sent to the hospital.
Those who were kept on board being chiefly
such as were affected with the scurvy, were
supplied with various refreshments in their
respective ships, and seemed to recover as
soon as if they had been sent on shore.
They had indeed almost every advantage enjoyed
by those at the hospital; for, besides
fresh meat thrice a week, and spruce beer
daily in common with the other seamen,
each man on the sick list was supplied every
week at the public expence with four pounds
of apples and half a pound of sope. There
were also thirty casks of limes taken in a
prize, which were distributed among the
scorbutic men, and proved of infinite use.
Admiral Pigot’s great zeal for the good of
the service, as well as his natural humanity,
induced him to listen to whatever was proposed
for the benefit of the men.</p>

<p>The supply of sope was a thing entirely
new in the service; but the good effect of
all the other articles would most probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
have been defeated, unless the men had been
furnished with the means of cleanliness,
which is the most essential requisite of health.
The advantage of this method will appear by
the returns of next month to have been very
conspicuous; and it was on this occasion
more than any other that I saw realised in
every particular the plan proposed in the
memorial to the Admiralty. It may be
added, that the sick that were left on board
were not even without the recreation of the
shore enjoyed by those at the hospital; for
most of the captains had the attention to
send daily on shore, for amusement and exercise,
such as were able to walk. Thus
there were all the advantages of an hospital
obtained at much less expence to Government,
and without the risque of intemperance,
desertion, or infection, which are the
inconveniencies connected with an hospital.
What farther contributed to health at this
time was, a large quantity of excellent wine
with which the fleet was supplied.

<p>The proportion of deaths in this month,
in relation to the whole number on board,
was only one in fourteen hundred and seventy-eight.</p>

<p>About one in twenty-nine of the sick was
sent to the hospital.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>
</div>

<p>There was, upon the whole, less sickness
and mortality in this month than in any
other during which I kept records of the
fleet. This was, no doubt, owing in part
to the climate, but was chiefly the effect of
the extraordinary attention paid to the refreshments
of the men. The fleet was here
exactly in the same situation, and at the
same season, two years before, but was not
near so healthy.</p>

<p>Nor were the advantages derived from the
great plenty of refreshments, procured at
this time at New York, merely temporary;
for the men’s constitutions were so much
improved by them, that the part of the
fleet which remained under the command of
Lord Hood was at sea for twelve weeks without
being affected by the scurvy. This was
chiefly to be ascribed to the previous refreshments;
for we have seen, that, in a passage
of seven weeks from Jamaica to New York,
the fleet was greatly affected with the scurvy,
in consequence of not having had the advantages
of fresh meat and vegetables when
last in port. The climate had, no doubt,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
also a share in keeping off the scurvy; for
the greater part of the twelve weeks was
taken up in a cruise off St. Domingo; and,
I believe, it never was known that a fleet
was so long at sea, in a cold climate, without
being greatly affected with this disease.</p>

<p>It appears, that though the proportion of
fevers had increased somewhat this month
over that of fluxes, yet the former were less
fatal; and, I think, the true dysentery is
more frequent in this climate, and more apt
to prove fatal in its acute state, than in the
West Indies. I have indeed preferred the
term flux to that of dysentery, for this reason,
that the symptoms in many cases did
not rise so high as properly to constitute dysentery;
and the disease proves fatal in the
West Indies more frequently in the chronic
than in the acute state. The fluxes were
daily gaining ground when we left New
York, and continued to prevail to a great
degree in the Magnificent, which remained
in that climate several weeks after us.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>The climate and situation of the fleet had
a greater effect in diminishing ulcers than
any other complaints; for the proportion
of them in this month is little more than
one third of what it was in the last.</p>

<p>The calculation for October was made upon
thirteen ships of the line, which sailed from
New York on the 25th of that month.</p>

<p>The weather had then begun to grow
cold; but few or none of the diseases peculiar
to a cold climate had appeared. There
occurred, while we were at New York,
several cases of inflammation of the liver
among the officers and men who came from
the West Indies. It was remarked formerly,
that this complaint hardly ever occurred
in the West Indies; but it would
appear that the residing there disposes to an
inflammation of this organ upon changing
to a colder climate.</p>

<p>The preceding summer had been uncommonly cold,
not only in North America,
but in the whole temperate part of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
northern hemisphere, so far as I could learn
by inquiry. In consequence of this, the
crops failed in Europe, America, and the
northern parts of Asia. The same circumstance
had a remarkable effect on the reigning
diseases of the season at New York;
for, instead of the bilious complaints common
in the end of summer and in autumn,
a slight fever of the inflammatory kind had
prevailed. An epidemic catarrh had spread
all over Europe, and some part of Asia, in
the earlier part of the year; and perhaps
this was connected with the peculiar state
of the atmosphere about this time. It was
before observed, that there was something
unusual in the state of the weather at Jamaica
while the fleet lay there; and it is
possible that this might be owing to the
same general cause.

<p>About a sixth part of the whole sick were
sent to the hospital this month, and one half
of these were sent to the hospital at Halifax
from the Magnificent.</p>

<p>The proportion of deaths this month, in
relation to the whole number on board, was
one in eight hundred and eighty-seven.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>
</div>

<p>Fewer were taken ill this month than
the preceding, but more in proportion died;
which might partly be owing to the fleet
having been more at sea, and partly to the
change of climate.</p>

<p>Fevers were now more numerous, and also
more fatal than any other disease; and we
see them follow the contrary proportion to
fluxes in the progress to the southward, that
they did in our progress to the northward.
These fevers prevailed chiefly in the Formidable
and Warrior. In the former it first
appeared among some men that had been
pressed at New York from a privateer, some
of whom were seized a few days after our
arrival at Barbadoes with the yellow fever,
and they were the only instances of it at this
time in the fleet.</p>

<p>The scurvy continued to diminish, but
the ulcers increased as we came into the
torrid zone.</p>

<p>Diseases in general were so slight and so
few at this time, that the whole squadron
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
from America sent only forty-eight men to
the hospital at Barbadoes from its arrival to
the end of the month.</p>

<p>It may be proper here to give an account
of some of the ships that remained on this
station, while the main body of the fleet was
in America.</p>

<p>The Prudent, when she left us, was extremely
healthy, and continued so till a flux
broke out in July, which was communicated
by some men from a cartel, who were
ill of this disease. It spread among the ship’s
company, and prevailed for three months.
The only deaths during the seven months
that this ship was separated from the fleet
were, two from flux, and one from scurvy,
and only twenty-five were sent to hospitals.
This is a proof how much more healthy
the windward station is than that of Jamaica.
The scurvy arose at one time, in a
cruise of five weeks, though there was no
appearance of it at another time in a cruise
of six weeks. The cause of this seems to
be the difference of the weather at the two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
periods; for it was very wet in the former,
and very dry in the latter. The time in
which this ship was most exposed to sickness
was while she was under repair at Antigua,
a situation in which hardly any ship escapes
a severe visitation of sickness; yet this ship
was not at all affected by it, which seemed
to be owing to the uncommon pains taken
by the captain to prevent the men from
labouring in the sun during the hot part of
the day.</p>

<p>The Nonsuch was five months separated
from the fleet, during which time ten men
died. Nine of these died of fevers, and one
of the dysentery. She sailed from Jamaica
for Barbadoes about the same time that the
fleet sailed for North America, and was nine
weeks on the passage. A fever was the
prevailing disease, and the men probably
inhaled the seeds of it at Jamaica, in common
with most of the other ships’ companies
that were there. The scurvy, which
had formerly prevailed so much, appeared
at this time; but it was in a very moderate
degree, considering the length of the passage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
None died of it, and few were so ill as to require
being sent to the hospital. Had this
ship gone into a colder climate, like the
others, it would probably have prevailed
to a greater degree. The whole number
sent to the hospitals for various complaints,
during the five months, was only thirteen.</p>

<p>The Nymph frigate was the only other
ship left in the West Indies which is included
in the tables. There happened only
two deaths in her from June to October,
both months included. One of these was
from scurvy, the other from asthma. She
was in that time upon two cruises, each of
which lasted eight weeks. During the first
the weather was dry and fine, and during
the other it was wet and sultry, with the
same effect upon health as in the Prudent;
for in the second cruise the scurvy prevailed
to a considerable degree, but not at all during
the first. This disease was prevented
from becoming violent or fatal, on either
occasion, by the great attention of Mr. Anderson,
the surgeon. He found great benefit
from the essence of malt, when given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
early in the complaint; and some limes having
been taken in a prize, while this disease
was at the worst, the scorbutic men
were so much recovered by the use of them,
that they were all able to return to duty before
the ship arrived in port.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<h4>DECEMBER.</h4>

<p>The whole squadron remained at anchor
at Barbadoes, and nothing worth notice occurred
till the arrival of a reinforcement of
eight ships of the line, under Sir Richard
Hughes, on the 8th of December. This
squadron had been detached by Lord Howe,
after the relief of Gibraltar, and the action
with the combined fleets on the 20th of
October. It consisted of one ship of 90
guns, one of 80, three of 74, and three of
64. They sailed from England on the 9th
of September, and from that time till their
arrival at Barbadoes they had not been in
port, except for ten days that they were at
Madeira, where they were supplied with
fresh meat, fruit, and vegetables, by which
means the scurvy, which had begun to prevail
to a considerable degree, was almost entirely
eradicated, and the health of the men
was surprisingly restored, for so short a time.</p>

<p>When they joined us, however, there was
a good deal of sickness on board of them all,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
except the Union and Ruby. The former
had been more than three years in commission,
and in that time had never been sickly,
and had now all the advantages of a long-established
and well-regulated ship’s company.
All the rest had been newly commissioned
and manned when they left England.
The superior health of the Ruby was owing
to her having been manned with the
crews of other ships, some of which had
just arrived from the West Indies; whereas
the others had been manned chiefly by
draughts of pressed men from guardships,
or by raw volunteers, of whom a great
many were raised in Ireland about this time.
The Bellona and Berwick having been somewhat
longer in commission than the rest,
were less sickly.</p>

<p>The following tables will shew the comparative
state of health of the squadron formerly
on the station with that which had
newly arrived from England.

<p>The proportion of the deaths this month
to the whole number of men belonging to
this part of the fleet, was one in four hundred
and forty.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>
</div>

<p>There were one hundred and eighty-nine
sent to the hospital; but the proportion to
the whole number of sick cannot be ascertained,
as we do not know how many were
on the list on the first of the month.</p>

<p>The increase of fevers in the old squadron
was chiefly owing to their having spread in
the Nonsuch; and they seemed to partake
more of that kind which originates in jails
and ships, than of that which is peculiar to
the climate. The body of one of the men
who died of this fever was inspected at the
hospital, and there was found to be inflammation
and even perforation of the intestines,
without any previous symptom that
could lead to expect such an appearance, a
circumstance more likely to happen in the
former sort of fever than the latter.</p>

<p>The increase of scurvy was owing to the
numbers that were taken ill of it in the
Magnificent on the passage from Halifax,
from whence she sailed in the beginning of
this month, and joined the fleet at Barbadoes
in the end of it. There was a great deal of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
sickness in this ship at Halifax, and on the
passage, owing to the want of such clothing
as was suitable to that severe climate. One
of the principal complaints was an inflammatory
sore throat.</p>

<p>There was no change in the situation of
the fleet, only that four ships of the line
were sent on the 16th to cruise near Guadaloupe,
and they continued at sea till the
beginning of February.</p>

<p>The new squadron was much afflicted
with the jail fever, brought from England;
and it was much more prevalent, as well as
malignant, on board of the Suffolk than any
of the rest. During the passage it prevailed
most in the Princess Amelia, not less than
twenty having died of it. It subsided in this
ship before she arrived in the West Indies;
but on board of the Suffolk it continued to
rage for some months after.</p>

<p>As the hospital at Barbadoes was too small
to contain all the sick of this squadron, only
the cases of greatest danger and the most infectious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
were sent on shore, and those that
remained were provided with fresh vegetables
and milk on board of their own ships, in the
same manner as had been formerly practised
with such success on similar occasions. This
was continued for four weeks, during which
time they all got into tolerable health, except
the Suffolk.</p>

<p>There appeared, by the returns of the
new squadron, to be a greater number under
the head of “Other Complaints,” which
was owing to the number of pulmonic complaints,
the consequence of the influenza
which prevailed in Europe, at sea, as well
as on shore, in the spring and beginning of
the summer of this year.</p>

<p>Though inflammatory complaints are rare
in this climate, yet in a few of the ships
there was some appearance of them; and I
remarked that they occurred in those ships
which were in other respects most healthy,
and most free from infection. A good many
of the men were seized with inflammatory
sore throats in the Bellona a few days before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
she arrived at Barbadoes, and this was in
other respects the most healthy ship next to
the Union and Ruby. In the Union there
was no violent acute complaint whatever,
which was very singular among so great a
body of men; but several rheumatisms,
coughs, and catarrhs, arose in her this month,
and there even occurred two pleurisies in the
following month. The bowel complaints
which occurred on board of this ship were
also of an inflammatory nature. These distempers
seemed to proceed from accidental
exposure and irregularity; and is it not
highly probable that these causes, instead of
producing local inflammatory complaints,
might have been the means of exciting bad
fevers and fluxes, as in the other ships, had
the men been equally predisposed to them,
by living in foul air, or under the influence
of infection?</p>

<p>The following tables will shew the comparative
state of health of the two squadrons
in the three first months of next year.

<p>The proportion of deaths to the whole
number was one in four thousand and eighty-seven.
About one in eleven of all the
sick were sent to the hospital.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>
</div>

<p>The main body of the fleet remained at
Barbadoes till the 12th of January, when
they went to cruise to windward of Martinico,
in order to intercept a French squadron
expected from North America. This
cruise lasted four weeks; and intelligence
being received of the enemy’s having taken
a different route, the whole fleet bore away
for St. Lucia, where it came to an anchor
on the 8th of February.</p>

<p>In the course of the three months above
mentioned, we see the two squadrons approaching
to each other, in point of health,
till they became pretty equal and similar;
and the new squadron became even somewhat
more healthy than the old.</p>

<p>The increase of fevers in the old squadron
was owing to two causes. One was the importation
of new-raised recruits brought
from England by some ships that arrived in
the beginning of January. These were distributed
to such ships as stood most in need
of men; and being very dirty and ill cloathed,
were likely to harbour infection. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
were evidently the cause of sickness in the
Warrior and Royal Oak; for these ships
were before that time healthy, and the fever
began with these strangers, and spread
amongst the former crew. It is remarkable
that the ships that brought them from England
were not affected by them.</p>

<p>It was caught in the Royal Oak from six
men that came from England in the Anson,
which men, though first put on board the
Namur, communicated no fever there, having
been kept separate from the rest of the
men; but being sent to the Royal Oak,
they were themselves first taken ill with a
fever, which afterwards spread to about
thirty of the other men. What was singular
in this fever was, that the eyes and skin
of all that were affected by it became yellow,
though without any particular malignancy;
for only two died on board, and one
in the hospital. There was one whose skin
was very yellow, yet his complaint was so
slight as never to confine him to his bed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>The other cause of the increased proportion
of fevers in the old squadron was, the
great number of these complaints that arose
in the Magnificent. This ship having been
sent on a cruise about the middle of February,
and the weather being rainy, squally,
and uncommonly cold, for the climate,
many fevers of the inflammatory kind appeared.
During this cruise she made prize
of a large French frigate, called the Concord,
and the greater part of the prisoners
being taken on board, the fever from that
time assumed a different type, with new and
uncommon symptoms; for, instead of being
inflammatory and requiring bleeding, as before,
it became more of a low, putrid kind,
and was attended in most cases, if not in all,
with a continual sweating; so that, instead
of evacuations, the remedies that were found
most effectual were the Peruvian bark, blisters,
and opium. Thus we see fevers variously
modified according to men’s constitutions,
the state of the air, and the noxious
<i>effluvia</i> of the strangers that intermix with
them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

<p>We find the proportion of fluxes increasing
in the new squadron in January and
February, as they had formerly done in most
of the ships soon after their arrival from
England. They were observed also to prevail
principally in those ships that had formerly
been most subject to fevers, and not
to arise till the fever had subsided. They
were found, for instance, to arise later in
the Suffolk, where the fever was obstinate
and malignant, than in the Princess Amelia,
where the fever had been at one time general
and fatal, but not so violent and lasting
as in the other.</p>

<p>The four ships that were sent to cruise
near Guadaloupe continued at sea for seven
weeks; and it was owing to the prevalence
of scurvy in these and in the Magnificent
that the proportion of that disease was
greater at this time in the old than in the
new squadron.</p>

<p>The fleet remained at St. Lucia till the
accounts of the peace arrived in the beginning
of April. The service was then at an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
end, and I returned to England with the
first division of the fleet, which sailed from
St. Lucia on the 12th of April, under the
command of Rear-admiral Sir Francis
Drake, who was at this time in extremely
bad health, and requested me to accompany
him.

<p>In order to judge of the loss sustained by
disease, in the course of that service of which
a relation has been attempted, the sick sent
to the hospitals must be taken into account.
I shall, therefore, give a short view of the
different diseases admitted, and their mortality,
at the several hospitals connected with
the fleets in which I served. This will
serve also to illustrate the different effects
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
that different situations have upon the health
and recovery of men<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>.</p>

<p>The fleet which effected the first relief of
Gibraltar, under the command of Lord
Rodney, consisting of twenty ships of the
line, arrived there in the third week of January,
1780, after a passage of three weeks
and a few days from England, in which
they had an action with the Spanish fleet,
and obtained a victory over them, on the
16th of that month. The whole fleet, except
one ship, sailed from Gibraltar on the
13th of February, and while it lay there,
the diseases sent to the hospital, and their
respective mortality, were as follows<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>:

<p>The fevers were chiefly from the five line-of-battle
ships that came immediately from
Europe in March. Upon their arrival they
sent on shore one hundred and ninety-three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
men ill of fevers, only one with the flux,
fifteen with the scurvy, and five with ulcers.</p>

<p>When these ships returned to Barbadoes
in May, along with the rest of the fleet,
the greater part of the sick were then also
on board of them. By that time the flux
and scurvy had broke out. The former
prevailed chiefly in the Terrible; the latter
in the Intrepid. That part of the fleet
which we found on the station sent on shore
a very small proportion of all the classes of
complaints, except wounds.</p>

<p>Of the wounds, nineteen were amputations,
of which there died nine, mostly of the
locked jaw. There were forty-six scorched
by gunpowder, of whom there died fourteen;
so that, besides those who were killed
outright, and those who died on board in
consequence of accidents of this kind, before
they could be sent to an hospital, about one
fourth of all the wounds, and the same proportion
of all the deaths from wounds, at
the hospital, was owing to this cause. This
circumstance ought to induce commanders
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
to take every precaution to prevent such accidents.
In the subsequent part of the war
they were less frequent, in consequence of
that greater caution, and more accurate method
of working great guns, which were
acquired by practice and experience<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>.</p>

<p>In the account of the mortality, I have
included only such as died before the 1st of
January, 1781; for if any were carried off
after that time, it was most probably by
some incidental complaint. There were sixty-five
of them at that time remaining, and
they were chiefly men disabled by lameness
waiting for a passage to England as invalids.</p>

<p>Out of the twenty-three that were killed
by the fall of the house in the hurricane on
the 10th of October, eight were of the number
above accounted for; but these are not
included in any of the classes of deaths.</p>

<p>The mortality among the men admitted
at this time was greater than what occurred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
afterwards in any of the hospitals that I attended,
except that at Jamaica. The principal
cause of this was, that as the fleet was
so much greater than had ever been known
here before, there was not suitable accommodation
for such numbers as it was necessary
to send on shore, and we had not then
fallen on the method of supplying refreshments
to the men on board of their ships.
The circumstance by which the men suffered
most was, the great crowding which
the want of room made necessary. There is
here no public building appropriated for an
hospital; so that this, as well as every thing
else, being found by contract, and the number
of sick being so much greater than it
was usual to provide for, the whole was at
this time conducted in a manner not very
regular.</p>

<p>It appears that the greatest mortality in
any class of disease was that of the fluxes,
of which the greatest number sent to hospitals
are such as have languished for some
time under this disease, in which state it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
generally proves fatal in the West Indies, in
consequence of incurable ulcers in the great
intestines, to which the heat of the climate,
as well as the scorbutic habit and sea diet, is
particularly unfavourable. But the whole
of the mischief arising from it does not appear
in the table; for it was the most apt of
any disease to supervene upon other complaints
which were under cure at the hospital.
It more particularly attacked those
who were recovering from the scurvy, and
was the cause of the greater number of
deaths under this head in the table. It was
found to be more contagious than fevers,
either because the men’s constitutions were
more predisposed to it, or, perhaps, because
the infectious matter of it being more gross
and less volatile, it is not so readily dissipated
by the heat of the climate; for, either from
this, or some other circumstance, infectious
fevers are not so easily generated, nor so apt
to spread, as in Europe. That these fluxes
were owing to infection may be inferred
from hence, that, when men ill of the
scurvy were cured on board of the ships
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
they belonged to, they were not liable to
this disease, neither did they prevail at these
hospitals afterwards, when great care was
taken to separate infectious diseases from the
others.</p>

<p>The only regular hospital on this station
is that at Antigua. This island being the
seat of the royal dock yard, there is an established
hospital in time of peace as well as
war. It so happened, that great fleets never
came here to put their sick and wounded on
shore, as at Barbadoes; so that the greater
number of those received into it were from
single ships that came to careen. As there
was, therefore, less necessity for crowding,
and as the slighter cases could be admitted,
there was a less proportion of deaths here
than at most of the other hospitals.</p>

<p>There were two other establishments for
the reception of the sick and wounded on
this station, but they were only temporary.
These were at St. Lucia and St. Christopher’s,
where the men being received in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
great numbers at a time from large fleets,
and as there were accommodations only for
the most urgent cases, the mortality approached
more nearly to that of Barbadoes.
There died at St. Christopher’s, in the years
1780 and 1781, in the proportion of one in
six, and at St. Lucia, in the same time, one
in five and a half, or two in eleven. The
air of the hospital at St. Lucia was remarkably
pure, and this degree of mortality was
owing to the sick having been accommodated
in tents and huts. In the two last
years of the war, when an hospital was
built, and regularly established, the mortality
was not much above one half of this.</p>

<p>Some authors have endeavoured to form
an estimate of the success of practice from
the different rates of mortality; but this is
extremely fallacious; for the fatality of diseases
will depend on their violence, the proportion
of deaths being very different in
cases that are slight, from what it is in those
that are dangerous. We shall take a view,
however, of the hospital at Barbadoes at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
another period, in which there seemed little
or no difference in the violence of the disease,
and when the superior success seemed
to be owing to the hospital’s not being so
crowded, and to the better attendance and
treatment of the sick. The following is a
view of the diseases that were admitted in
the last three months of the year 1782,
the greater part of which were landed from
the reinforcement of eight ships of the line
that joined the fleet at Barbadoes in the beginning
of December:

<p>It happened on this, as on the former occasion,
that none were sent on shore but
such as were very ill, or had contagious
complaints, the rest being provided with refreshments
on board of their ships. There
were no wounds at this time, but there was
a greater proportion of fevers; so that the
complaints, upon the whole, might be said
to be about equally dangerous. The mortality
now was, however, considerably less,
and this is to be imputed to the more favourable
situation of the hospital, which I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
did not allow to be overcrowded; and the
men had all manner of justice done them in
point of attendance and accommodation.</p>

<p>I shall give another example of the same
kind in the hospital at Jamaica, when our
fleet went there after the battle of the 12th
of April. All the men accounted for here
were landed from the fleet under Lord Rodney

<p>This uncommon degree of mortality was
not owing to the bad air of the place, for
Port Royal is naturally as healthy as most
parts in that climate; nor was it owing to
bad accommodations, or to neglect of any
kind; but is imputable entirely to this circumstance,
that the hospital being extremely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
small, those only were sent to it who were
very ill. There were at this time upwards
of forty ships of the line at Jamaica, and an
hospital, containing only three hundred
beds, could afford but a very inadequate
relief. Some officers are unwilling that any
man should die on board of their ships, for
fear of dispiriting the others; and many
were sent to the hospital, in the most desperate
stage of sickness, that they might
there die.</p>

<p>There cannot be a stronger proof than
this of the fallacy of judging of the success
of practice by the proportion of the deaths;
for the sick on this occasion were better accommodated,
better provided for in every
respect, and as regularly attended, as at any
other period of my service in the West Indies,
yet the mortality was greater than at
any other time.</p>

<p>Having given instances of the common
rate of mortality in hospitals in Europe and
the West Indies, I shall next give examples
of the success we had in North America,

<p>The difference of mortality here, from
what occurred in the West Indies, is partly
imputable to climate, and partly to the
smaller number of acute diseases. In the
two accounts last stated, the difference in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
favour of the latter seemed chiefly to arise
from the superior attention to the sick, and
the better treatment of them. It was mentioned
before, that in autumn, 1782, at
New York, they were better supplied, both
at hospitals and on board of their ships,
with every thing that could be wished, and
that on this occasion almost every scheme I
had proposed was realised. The extraordinary
success in the scurvy was owing to the
great quantities of vegetables that were supplied;
for several fields of cabbages had
been planted in the neighbourhood of the
hospital for the use of the sick. This was
owing to the humane attention of Admiral
Digby, who had also caused cows to be
purchased to supply the hospital with milk.
Cleanliness, and the separation of diseases,
were also strictly attended to; and I am
persuaded that many of the scorbutic men
were saved by keeping them separated from
the fevers and fluxes; for it has been observed,
that men ill of the scurvy, or recovering
from it, are very apt to be infected,
particularly with the flux.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<p>It appears, that the disease in which climate
makes the greatest difference is the
flux. It was observable, that though the
dysentery at this time was more fatal on
board of the ships at New York than in
the West Indies, yet it was less so at
the hospital. The cause of this seems to
be, that the acute state of this disease, of
which men die on board before there is
time to remove them to an hospital, is more
fatal in a cold climate; but when it becomes
more protracted, which is the case
with most of the cases sent to hospitals,
they then do much better in a cold than in
a hot climate.</p>

<p>I shall here subjoin an account of the
numbers that were admitted, and died, during
the whole war, at the hospitals of the
different parts at which the fleets I was
connected with touched.

<p>I have been able to calculate the numbers
of deaths from disease in this great fleet,
both on board and at hospitals, during the
period of my own service, which was three
years and three months, and they amounted
to three thousand two hundred<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> independent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
of those that were killed and died of
wounds.</p>

<p>There died of disease in the fleet I belonged
to, from July, 1780, to July, 1781,
about one man in eight, including both
those who died on board and at hospitals<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>.
But the annual mortality in the West-India
fleet, during the last year of the war, that
is, from March, 1782, to March, 1783,
was not quite one in twenty<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>. This difference
was partly owing to the general increase
of health in fleets as a war advances,
partly to some improvements in victualling,
and partly to better accommodations as well
as regulations in what related to the care of
the sick.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<p>Though the mortality in fleets in the
West Indies is, upon the whole, greater than
in Europe, yet it has so happened, that, in
the late war, the fleet at home has, at particular
periods, been considerably more sickly
than that in the West Indies was at any one
time. I was informed by Dr. Lind, that,
when the grand fleet arrived at Portsmouth
in November, 1779, a tenth part of all the
men were sent to the hospital. It appears<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
that in the years 1780 and 1781, a period at
which the fleet in the West Indies was most
sickly, the medium of the numbers on the
sick list was one in fifteen, and many of
these were very slight complaints; whereas,
in the fleet alluded to in England, the diseases
were mostly fevers, and so ill as actually
to be sent to the hospital. It appears
likewise, that there was the greatest proportion
of sick in our fleet when it was on the
coast of America in September, 1780<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>.
This difference is owing to the greater prevalence
of the ship fever, and of the scurvy,
in a cold than in a hot climate.</p>

<p>With regard to the mortality at hospitals,
the comparison is greatly in favour of those
in England. This is owing to the greater
regularity, and the better accommodation
and diet, which an hospital at home admits
of, as well as to the difference of climate. It
has also been mentioned, that, on most occasions,
the hospitals I attended abroad were so
limited as to contain only the worst cases, in
consequence of which there would of course
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
be a greater proportional mortality than in
the great hospitals of England.</p>

<p>The following is an account of the whole
loss of lives from disease, and by the enemy<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>,

<h2 id="PART_II_INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>In the year 1780 I printed a small treatise
for the use of the fleet, containing general
rules for the prevention of sickness;
and this part of the work is chiefly taken
from it.</p>

<p>My own opportunities of experience, as
exhibited in the preceding Part, have been
sufficiently extensive to suggest many observations
on this subject; but as my object is
utility, rather than the praise of originality,
I shall not confine myself to these. Great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
part of what is to be advanced is taken from
books<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> and conversation, as well as my own
experience, my design being to exhibit a
concise view of all the discoveries on this
subject that have come to my knowledge.
I have assumed nothing, however, from
mere report or testimony, having had opportunities,
from my own observations, of
verifying or disproving the assertions of
others.</p>

<p>More may be done towards the preservation
of the health and lives of seamen than
is commonly imagined; and it is a matter
not only of humanity and duty, but of interest
and policy.</p>

<p>Towards the forming of a seaman a sort
of education is necessary, consisting in an
habitual practice in the exercise of his profession
from an early period of life; so that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
if our stock of mariners should come to be
exhausted or diminished, this would be a
loss that could not be repaired by the most
flourishing state of the public finances; for
money would avail nothing to the public
defence without a sufficient number of able
and healthy men, which are the real resources
of a state, and the true sinews of
war.</p>

<p>In this view, as well as from the peculiar
dependence of Britain on her navy, this order
of men is truly inestimable; and even
considering men merely as a commodity, it
could be made evident, in an œconomical and
political view, independent of moral considerations,
that the lives and health of men
might be preserved at much less expence
and trouble than what are necessary to repair
the ravages of disease.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<p>It would be endless to enumerate the accounts
furnished by history of the losses and
disappointments to the public service from
the prevalence of disease in fleets. Sir
Richard Hawkins, who lived in the beginning
of the last century, mentions, that in
twenty years he had known of ten thousand
men who had perished by the scurvy.
Commodore Anson, in the course of his
voyage of circumnavigation, lost more than
four fifths of his men chiefly by that disease.
History supplies us with many instances
of naval expeditions that have been
entirely frustrated by the force of disease
alone: that under Count Mansfeldt in 1624;
that under the Duke of Buckingham the
year after; that under Sir Francis Wheeler
in 1693; that to Carthagena in 1741;
that of the French under D’Anville in 1746;
and that of the same nation to Louisbourg
in 1757<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>That the health of a ship’s company depends
in a great measure upon means within
our power, is strongly evinced by this, that
different ships in the same situation of service
enjoy very different degrees of health.
Every one who has served in a great fleet
must have remarked, that out of ships with
the same complement of men, who have
been the same length of time at sea, and
have been victualled and watered in the same
manner, some are extremely sickly, while
others are free from disease. Is it not naturally
to be inferred from hence, that the
health of men at sea depends in a great
measure upon circumstances within the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
power of officers, and, indeed, upon their
exertions, much more than medical care<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>?</p>

<p>It has appeared in the preceding part of
this work, that the diseases most prevalent
among seamen are fevers, fluxes, and the
scurvy. These are indeed some of the most
fatal that can attack the human body; but
there is a numerous tribe of complaints,
which are also some of the most severe
scourges of human nature, from which
they are in a manner entirely exempt.&mdash;These
are the diseases to which the indolent
and luxurious are subject, and which so far
embitter their life as to render their portion
of worldly enjoyment nearly on a level with
that of the poor and laborious. The diseases
alluded to are chiefly the gout, stomach
complaints, hypochondriac and other nervous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
disorders. In all countries it is the better
sort of people that are most subject to
these; for they are owing to the want of
bodily exercise, to the great indulgence of
the senses, and a greater keenness and delicacy
in the passions and sentiments of the
mind. Man being formed by nature for
active life, it is necessary to his enjoying
health that his muscular powers should be
exercised, and that his senses should be habituated
to a certain strength of impression.
Animal and vegetable nature may be aptly
enough compared to each other in this respect;
for a tree or plant brought up in a
greater degree of shelter and shade than what
is suitable to its nature, will be puny and
sickly; it will neither attain its natural
growth nor strength of fibre, nor will it be
able to bear the influence of the weather,
nor the natural vicissitudes of heat and cold
to which it may be exposed.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked, however, that exercise
and temperance may be carried to excess,
and that in these there is a certain salutary
medium; for when labour and abstinence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>

amount to hardship, they are equally
pernicious as indulgence and indolence.
This is strongly exemplified in seamen; for,
in consequence of what they undergo, they
are in general short lived, and have their
constitutions worn out ten years before the
rest of the laborious part of mankind. A
seaman, at the age of forty-five, if shewn to
a person not accustomed to be among them,
would be taken by his looks to be fifty-five,
or even on the borders of sixty<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>.</p>

<p>The most common chronic complaints
which a long course of fatigue, exposure to
the weather, and other hardships, tend to
bring on, are pulmonary consumptions,
rheumatisms, and dropsies. It is also to be
considered, that these complaints, particularly
the last, are farther fomented by hard
drinking, which is a common vice among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
this class of men, and they are led to indulge
in it by the rigorous and irregular
course of duty incident to their mode of life.</p>

<p>With regard to gout, indigestion, hypochondriac
complaints, and low spirits, there
is something in hard labour of every kind
that tends to avert them, and particularly in
that rough mode of it peculiar to a sea life.
There is also something in the harsh sensations
from the objects which seamen are in
use to see, hear, and handle, which so modifies
their constitutions and hardens their
nerves as to make them little liable to what
may be called the diseases of excessive refinement,
such as those above mentioned. I
have, indeed, met with such diseases at
naval hospitals; but I always remarked that
they were in landsmen who had been pressed,
and who had been bred to sedentary and indolent
occupations.</p>

<p>The diseases above enumerated, as well as
most other chronic complaints, being the
offspring of indolence and luxury, while
fevers and feverish complaints fall equally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
on all ranks and descriptions of men, it
was a saying of some of the ancients, that
acute diseases were sent from heaven<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>;
whereas chronic diseases were of man’s own
creation. But I shall endeavour in the
course of this work to evince, that, with regard
to seamen at least, acute diseases are as
much artificial as any others, being the offspring
of mismanagement and neglect; with
this difference, that they are imputable not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
so much to the misconduct of the sufferers
themselves, as of those under whose protection
they are placed.</p>

<p>If I were to add any other complaint to
the three already mentioned, as most prevalent,
and peculiar to a sea life, it would be
those foul and incurable ulcers which are so
apt to arise at sea, particularly in a hot climate.
The slightest scratch, or the smallest
pimple, more especially on the lower extremities,
is apt to spread, and to become an
incurable ulcer, so as to end in the loss of a
limb. The nature of the diet, and the malignant
influence of the climate, both conspire
in producing them.</p>

<p>The diseases most frequent and prevalent
at sea have this advantage, that they are
more the subjects of prevention than most
others, because they depend upon remote
causes that are assignable, and which increase
and diminish according to certain circumstances,
which are in a great measure within
our power.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span></p>

<p>The prevention of diseases is an object
as much deserving our attention as their
cure; for the art of physic is at best but
fallible, and sickness, under the best medical
management, is productive of great inconvenience,
and is attended with more or
less mortality. The means of prevention
are also more within our power than those
of cure; for it is more in human art to remove
contagion, to alter a man’s food and
cloathing, to command what exercise he is
to use and what air he is to breathe, than it
is to produce any given change in the internal
operations of the body. What we know
concerning prevention is also more certain
and satisfactory, in as much as it is easier to
investigate the external causes that affect
health than to develope the secret springs of
the animal œconomy.</p>

<p>This part of the work, therefore, is
chiefly addressed to those who direct the
navy either in a civil or military capacity;
for the general health of ships depends so
much upon the victualling and manning in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
the first instance, and, afterwards, on the
degree of discipline and order which are
kept up, that I am persuaded that a certain
degree of attention on their part would
almost entirely eradicate disease from our
fleets.</p>

<p>Several remarks in this part of the work
will be found so obvious, that it might
seem superfluous to mention them. But it
has been my intention to omit nothing that
I have heard of or observed as a matter of
ascertained utility, and, I believe, the most
experienced will find either something new,
or what they had not before sufficiently attended
to. Though the design of it is that
of being extensively useful, yet my trouble
would be compensated, should it prove the
means of health and comfort to a single
ship’s company; nay, I should not repent
my labour, could I enjoy the conscious certainty
of its being the means of saving the
life of one brave and good man.</p>

<p>The prevention of disease has relation
only to the external causes that affect health,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
and I shall consider these under the four
heads of</p>

<p>
I. AIR,<br />
II. ALIMENT,<br />
III. EXERCISE,<br />
IV. CLOATHING.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<h2 id="PART_II_CHAP_I">CHAP. I.<br />

<span id="AIR" class="large">AIR.</span></h2>

<p>Under this head I shall not only consider
the natural state of the air of the atmosphere
in point of heat and cold, moisture
and dryness, purity and corruption,
but also the different artificial impregnations
of it from the holds or other parts of a
ship, or from the persons of men who have
been neglected in point of cleanliness.</p>

<p>The common air of the atmosphere at sea
is purer than on shore, which gives to a sea
life a very great advantage over a life at
land. This advantage is still greater in the
tropical regions, where the land air, especially
such as proceeds from woods and
marshes, is so fatal, and where the heat is
also considerably less at sea than on shore.
But this superior purity of the air at sea is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
more than counterbalanced by the artificial
means of propagating diseases on board of
a ship. Since a sea life, however, has this
great natural advantage to health, the causes
of disease peculiar to it are chargeable rather
to the mismanagement of men than to
any thing unavoidable in nature; and we
are from this encouraged to exert our endeavours
in removing them.</p>

<p>The effects of land air, however, are not
to be neglected by those who are studious of
preserving the health of a ship’s company,
for seamen are exposed to it in various ways
while they are in harbour; and this is what
we shall first treat of.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<h3 id="CHAP_I_SECT_I">SECT. I.<br />

<span class="medium">Of the noxious Effects of <span class="smcap">Land Air</span> in
particular Situations.</span></h3>

<p>All the diseases incident to a fleet, except
the scurvy, are more apt to arise in a
harbour than at sea, and particularly the violent
fevers peculiar to hot climates. There
are generally woods and marshes adjacent to
the anchoring places in the West Indies,
and the men are exposed to the bad air proceeding
from thence, either in consequence
of the ship’s riding to leeward of them, or
of people’s going on shore on the duties of
wooding and watering. Instances of this,
without number, might be adduced from the
accounts of voyages to all the tropical countries.
Our fatal expeditions to the Bastimentos,
and to Carthagena, in former wars,
are striking proofs of it; and we have seen
the same effects, though in a much less degree,
while the fleet was at Jamaica in 1782.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p>I have known a hundred yards in a road
make a difference in the health of a ship at
anchor, by her being under the lee of
marshes in one situation, and not in the
other<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>. Where people at land are so situated,
as not to be exposed to the air of woods
and marshes, but only to the sea air, they
are equally healthy as at sea. There was a
remarkable instance of this on a small island,
called Pidgeon Island, formerly described,
where forty men were employed in making
a battery, and they were there from June
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
to December, which includes the most unhealthy
time of the year, without a man
dying, and with very little sickness among
them, though they worked hard, lived on
salt provisions, and had their habitations entirely
destroyed by the hurricane. During
this time near one half of the garrison of
St. Lucia died, though in circumstances
similar in every respect, except the air of
the place, which blew from woods and
marshes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

<p>The duties of wooding and watering are
so unwholesome, that negroes, if possible,
should be hired to perform them. In general,
however, the employing of seamen in
filling water and cutting wood is unavoidable,
but it should be so managed as not to
allow them, on any account, to stay on shore
all night; for, besides that the air is then
more unwholesome, men, when asleep, are
more susceptible of any harm, either from
the cold or the impurity of air, than when
awake and employed.</p>

<p>As the service necessarily requires that men
should be on shore more or less, however
unwholesome the air may be, means are to
be used to prevent its pernicious impressions
on the body. Certain internal medicines,
such as bitters, aromatics, and small quantities
of spirituous liquors, tend to preserve
the body from its bad effects. Of the bitters,
Peruvian bark is, perhaps, the best;
and there is a well-affected instance of its
efficacy in the account given by Mr. Robertson
of a voyage in the Rainbow to the
coast of Africa; and by the same means
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
Count Bonneval and his suite escaped sickness
in the camps in Hungary, while half
of the army were cut off by fevers. In
consequence of Mr. Robertson’s representation
of the effects of bark in curing and preventing
the fevers of that climate, the ships
of war fitted out for the coast of Guinea have
been supplied with it gratuitously, and Government
would find its account in extending
this bounty to all the tropical stations.</p>

<p>We have seen, in the former part of this
work, that the fever produced by the impure
air of marshes may not appear for many
days after the noxious principle, whatever it
is, has been imbibed; men having been
sometimes seized with it more than a week
after they had been at sea. It naturally occurs,
therefore, that something may be done
in the intermediate time to prevent the effects
of this bad air; and nothing is more
adviseable than to take some doses of Peruvian
bark, after clearing the bowels by a
purgative. Some facts, related in the first
part of this work, show that an interval of
ten days or a fortnight may elapse between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
the imbibing of the poison and its taking
effect. And, in order to guard against the
diseases of this climate in general, it would
be more proper to take some large doses of
bark once in either of these periods, than to
make a constant practice of taking a little,
as I have known some people do, by which
they may also render their body in some
measure insensible to its good effects. I
knew a physician of some eminence in the
West Indies, who always enjoyed uninterrupted
health, and he imputed it to his taking
from half an ounce to an ounce of
bark every change and full of the moon, as
he thought that fevers of the intermitting
and remitting kind, were more apt to occur
at these periods. Whether this idea be well
founded or not, the practice is proper, upon
the other principle that has been mentioned,
and the phases of the moon will at least
serve as an aid to the memory.</p>

<p>The spices of the country, such as capsicum
and ginger, for which nature has given
the inhabitants of the torrid zone an appetite,
have also been found powerful in fortifying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
the body against the influence of noxious
air. Either these, or the bark, or similar
substances, of a bitter and aromatic nature,
given in a glass of spirits to men going
upon unwholesome duty, have been found
to have a powerful effect in preventing them
from catching the fevers of the climate.
The practice may be thought too troublesome
in the hurry of service in a great fleet;
and I in general avoid mentioning any thing
but what is easily practicable, and highly
important to the body of seamen at large;
but such a precaution may be of service at
least to officers, or to a ship’s company,
when service is easy, or on a small scale.</p>

<p>But besides the poisonous effluvia of woods
and marshes, the sensible qualities of the air
are also to be attended to. If I were required
to fix on the circumstances most
pernicious to Europeans, particularly those
newly arrived in the West Indies, I would
say, that they are too much bodily exercise
in the sun, and sleeping in the open air; and
the practices most hurtful next to these are,
intemperance in drinking, and bad hours.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
The sickness and mortality among new
comers may, in general, be imputed to some
one of these causes. It is in favour of this
opinion that women are not subject to the
same violent fevers as the other sex, which
is probably owing to their not giving into
the above-mentioned irregularities.</p>

<p>The last direction I shall mention with
regard to the preservation of health in a
harbour is, that the ship should be made to
ride with a spring on the cable, that the
side may be turned to the wind, whereby
a free ventilation will be produced, and the
foul air from the head, which is the most
offensive part, will not be carried all over
the decks, as it must be when the ship rides
head to wind.</p>

<p>Having little experience of my own with
regard to diseases at sea in cold climates, I
cannot recommend any particular precautions;
but Dr. Lind thinks that garlick infused
in spirits is one of the best preservatives
against the bad effects of cold and wet.
The French ships of war are furnished with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
great quantities of garlick as an article of
victualling, and its effects seem to be very
salutary. It would appear, that substances
of this kind are very conducive to health in
hot climates also. I was informed by Capt.
Caldwell, that, when he commanded a sloop
of war on the coast of Guinea, he was supplied
with a large quantity of shalots by a
Portuguese about the time he left the coast,
and his men were remarkably healthy on the
passage to the West Indies, while the other
ships in company, who wanted this supply,
were very sickly.</p>

<p>But besides the obvious and sensible qualities
of the air above mentioned, there are
certain obscure properties which we do not
understand, and which we find difficult to
investigate; for there are diseases prevailing
in certain places which seem to depend on
some latent state of the air. Of this kind is
the complaint of the liver, so common in
the East Indies, yet almost entirely unknown
in the West Indies; and in the West Indies
there are certain diseases which prevail in
one island and not in another; such as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
<i>elephantiasis</i><a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> of Barbadoes, which is an affection
of the lymphatics peculiar to that
island. In the climates of Europe there are
also certain obscure conditions of the air
that favour one epidemic more than another,
and in some years more than others<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>. All
this is very mysterious to us; and although
we could detect these properties of the air,
we probably could not prevent their bad effects,
since man must every where breathe
the air, whatever its qualities may be.

<h3 id="CHAP_I_SECT_II">SECT. II.<br />

<span class="medium">Of <span class="smcap">Foul Air</span> from the Neglect of Cleanliness
in Men’s Persons&mdash;<span class="smcap">Infection</span>.</span></h3>

<p>Nature has wisely so contrived our
senses and instincts, that the neglect of
cleanliness renders a person loathsome and
offensive to himself and others, thereby
guarding against those fatal diseases that
arise from bodily filth. The noxious air we
speak of is generated by men keeping the
same clothes too long in contact with the
body, while they are at the same time confined
and crowded in small and ill-ventilated
apartments. Such is the origin of the jail
fever, otherwise called the ship and hospital
fever; and it seems to be with reason that
Dr. Cullen ascribes the low, nervous fever of
Britain to a similar origin, being caused, as
he thinks, by an infection of a milder kind,
arising in the clothes and houses of the
poor, who, from slovenliness or indigence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
neglect to change their linen, and air their
houses.</p>

<p>Man is evidently more subject to disease
than any other species of the animal creation,
owing partly to the natural feebleness
of his frame, but still more perhaps to the
artificial modes of life which his reason
leads him to adopt. There is no circumstance
of this kind by which health is more
affected than by clothing. Some of the
most fatal and pestilential diseases are produced
and communicated by it; for we see
that the greater number of fevers, particularly
those of the low and malignant sort,
may be traced to the want of personal
cleanliness.</p>

<p>There are few subjects more mysterious
and difficult of investigation than this of infection.
The origin of specific contagions,
such as the small pox and the venereal disease,
seems to be almost beyond the reach
of a conjecture; and why all the contagions
we know, excepting that of the bite of a
mad dog, should be confined to one species
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
of animal, their effects not being communicable
to any other, is equally unaccountable.
Why is the body incapable of being affected
more than once by certain morbid poisons;
and whence comes the striking and curious
differences of susceptibility to infection in
different individuals at the same time, and
of the same individual at different times?</p>

<p>It would appear that the infection of
fever, which we are chiefly to consider here,
does not, like some of the diseases above
mentioned, depend on the continued propagation
of a certain poison, but that it may
spontaneously arise from a concurrence of
circumstances, producing a long stagnation
of the effluvia of the body on the clothes,
for want of clean linen, while people are
excluded from the free air, as in jails, hospitals,
or ships.</p>

<p>In order, therefore, to preserve the crews
of ships from such diseases, means should
be taken not only to prevent the introduction
of infection already existing, but to prevent
the generation of it on board.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<h3 id="MEANS_OF_PREVENTING_THE_INTRODUCTION_OF_INFECTION">1. Means of preventing the Introduction of
Infection.</h3>

<p>War being a state of violence and
confusion, in which the hurry and emergency
of service may be such as to render it
impossible to put in practice all the rules
which might be laid down concerning the
preservation of health, yet it is necessary
that those who direct the navy, either in a
civil or military capacity, should be aware
of the causes of sickness and mortality, in
order to guard against them as far as is
practicable. From an indolent acquiescence
in this idea of the hardships and inconveniences
of war being unavoidable, I have
known neglect to arise in the conduct of officers
with regard to those under their command,
as if it was not the duty of a commander
to employ his utmost attention to
alleviate the misfortunes and mitigate the
sufferings of his fellow creatures; and we
have seen that much more of the calamities
of war arise from disease than from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
sword. The like excuse might be framed
for the neglect of stores and arms, which,
the hurry of service might equally expose
to injury. We see, indeed, infinite pains
taken to prevent cordage from rotting, and
arms from rusting; but however precious
these may be as the necessary resources of
war, it will not be disputed that the lives of
men are still more so; yet, though there is
the additional inducement of humanity to
watch over the health of men, I do not
think that this, in general, is studied with
a degree of attention equal to what is bestowed
on some inanimate objects.</p>

<p>Ships of war are exposed to infection
chiefly by receiving such men as have been
raised by pressing, who are frequently confined
in guardships, under such circumstances
of bad air and bodily filth as tend to
generate the most virulent infection. The
service also requires sometimes that men be
received from jails, and they are either criminals
delivered over by the civil jurisdiction
of the country, or captives who have
been restored by the enemy after a course of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
confinement in their prisons. It may happen
too, as we have seen<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>, that the enemy,
who are made prisoners at sea, may have infection
about them, and will communicate
it the more readily that they are strangers.</p>

<p>There are few fevers but what are infectious
at some stage or other of the disease;
but it is not necessary that fever should actually
exist in order to create infection. In
the most violent and pestilential fevers, such
as have sometimes originated in the jails of
England, the persons who communicated
them were not affected with it themselves<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>.
Infection, like some other poisons, does not
affect those who are accustomed to it, and
therefore those who are in the habit of being
exposed to it frequently escape its bad effects,
especially if it is gradually applied, as must
be the case with those about whose persons
it is generated. For the like reason, physicians
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
and nurses are less susceptible than
others; and strangers, who are accustomed
to a pure air, are the most susceptible of
any. It is observed by Dr. Short, that contagious
epidemics are more frequent and
fatal in the country than in London, and
this may probably be accounted for on the
same principle; for every person in a great
town is exposed to the breath and effluvia
of others, and to a variety of putrid exhalations,
which are unavoidable where multitudes
inhabit together; but they are so used
to them, that they are not affected by them;
whereas in the country, where people are
less accustomed to each other’s company,
and less used to impure air in general, they
are the more readily affected when infection
is introduced among them. It may even
admit of a doubt if any society of men,
living together, are entirely free from morbid
contagion. It certainly sometimes happens,
that a ship, with a long-established
crew, shall be very healthy; yet, if strangers
are introduced among them, who are
also healthy, sickness will be mutually produced.
This principle in the human constitution,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
by which the presence of strangers
affects it, is well illustrated by a fact<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>,
founded on the best testimony, that, in one
of the small western islands of Scotland,
which is so remote, that the inhabitants
are frequently without any communication
with strangers for several months together;
they become so susceptible, in consequence
of this long interruption of intercourse,
that they are seized with a catarrh when
strangers of any description come among
them. It was said before, that cleanliness
was founded on a natural aversion to what
is unseemly and offensive in the persons of
others; and there seems also to be implanted
in human nature, for the same purpose,
an instinctive horror at strangers, as is visible
in young children and uncultivated people.
In the early ages of Rome, one word
signified both a stranger and an enemy<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>These observations naturally suggest several
useful and practical remarks. It would appear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
that the utmost attention is necessary
not only to guard against the actual presence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
of disease, but to be jealous of all new
draughts of men, especially if they should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
come from guardships, jails, or tenders, and
have been turned over from ships where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
disease is known to have prevailed; nay,
that it is best to avoid mixtures of any kind.</p>

<p>The infection of fevers seems different
from most others in this, that it is very
various in its degrees of virulence. There
is reason to think that the poison of the
small pox, and that of the venereal disease,
are in their own nature invariable, and that
the difference of these diseases, in point of
malignancy, depends on the constitution and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
other circumstances of those affected; whereas
that of fevers being of different degrees
of activity, and being frequently obscure
and latent, is, on that account, the more
treacherous, and ought to be watched with
the greater circumspection.</p>

<p>The mode of manning the navy by pressing,
I take it for granted, is unavoidable; at
any rate, it would not become me to arraign
a practice which has had the public sanction
for ages. It is, however, one of the principal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
means both of generating and spreading
the seeds of disease, in consequence of the
indiscriminate seizure of men for the public
service, and the confinement that is necessary
to secure them. And as the exigences
of the service make it necessary to admit
persons of every description, there is no
other remedy for this evil but to annihilate,
if possible, the contagion that may thus be
conveyed into ships of war. This is done
by stripping and washing the new recruits
who may be suspected of importing infection;
also by cutting off their hair, clothing
them with new clothes, and destroying
the old, before they are allowed to mix with
the ship’s company in which they are to
enter.</p>

<p>Those who have put these methods strictly
in practice, have been sensible of their
great utility; and the most exact attention
is necessary, as a single infected man, or
even any part of his clothing, may spread
sickness through a whole ship’s company.
When we reflect what havock an infectious
fever sometimes makes in a ship, it will appear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
how very important this fort of attention
is; and when the cause of the sickliness
of particular ships is traced to its
source, it will generally be found to have
originated from taking on board infected
men at Spithead, or wherever else the ship’s
company may have been completed.</p>

<p>After the first edition of this part of the
work was printed, an excellent institution
was established at Portsmouth for the prevention
of infection. A ship was appointed
for the reception of the recruits of the fleet
to which they were carried, to be stripped,
washed, and provided with new apparel,
before they joined their respective ships.
This had a visible good effect on the health
of the fleet; and it was planned and executed
by Sir Charles Middleton, Comptroller
of the Navy, whole unwearied assiduity,
as well as integrity and ability in that important
post, claim the highest praise and
gratitude from his country.</p>

<p>It follows farther, from the preceding observations,
that there is a sort of risque in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
mixing two different sorts of men, even
when there is no actual disease or suspicion
of infection; for, whether it is from dormant
infection, or merely from the circumstance
of change of air, such mixtures are
known from experience to be sometimes
productive of sickness. The late Admiral
Boscawen was so sensible of this, that he
avoided it, unless when some evident utility
or necessity of service made it proper; and
upon this principle he used to resist the solicitation
of captains when they requested to
carry men from one ship to another upon
changing their commands.</p>

<p>One probable reason, among others, for
ships of the line being more sickly than frigates
or smaller ships is, that in greater
numbers there is a greater chance of men
of various descriptions and modes of life
being mixed together.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<h3 id="MEANS_OF_PREVENTING_THE_PRODUCTION_OF_INFECTION">
2. Means of preventing the Production of Infection.</h3>

<p>The infection of fever is not always imported
from without, but may be originally
and spontaneously generated on board. The
causes of this, as mentioned before, are want
of personal cleanliness, and also confinement
and crowding in close apartments.</p>

<p>In order to promote cleanliness, care should
be taken that every man, on his first entering
into the service, be provided with a proper
change of linen, and that a frequent
muster and review be made, in order to inspect
their persons, and to examine their
stock of apparel. A true seaman is in general
cleanly, but the greater part of men
in a ship of war require a degree of compulsion
to make them so; and such is the depravity
of many, that it is common enough
for them to dispose of their clothes for money
to purchase spirituous liquors. A muster
and review, therefore, wherein men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
should be obliged once in the week to present
themselves clean before their officers,
and to produce a certain necessary quantity
of clean apparel, would conduce both to
sobriety and cleanliness. The exertion of
authority, and the infliction of punishment,
is so far from being considered by the men
as a hardship, that they expect it; and it is
the duty of an officer, as it is of a parent to
a child, to constrain those entrusted to his
care to perform what is for their good. It
is common also for men to lay up their
clothes in a wet and unwashed state, which
in time is productive of the most offensive
and unwholesome vapours; and this can be
prevented only by their chests and bags
being frequently inspected by their superiors.</p>

<p>It must be evident to any one who reflects
on this subject, that a regulation of this
kind is as necessary as any other part of
duty; and it deserves to be made an article
in the public instructions, instead of being
left to the discretion of officers. This sort
of discipline is particularly necessary in ships
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
of the line, in which one cause of the greater
unhealthiness is the difficulty of taking cognizance
of so great a number; for, unless
some regular method, as by muster, is established,
there will be men who will escape
notice, and skulk below, indulging in laziness
and filth.</p>

<p>The good sense and humanity of many
captains in the late war, led them to adopt
certain methodical regulations for the preservation
of cleanliness and order. The only
public sanction given to this sort of discipline,
was that of Lord Howe, who gave
it in orders to those under his command,
that each ship’s company should be divided
into as many divisions as there were lieutenants,
and that these should be divided into
squads, with a midshipman appointed to
each; and that the officers should be respectively
responsible for the good order and discipline
of the men assigned to them.</p>

<p>It is an excellent custom, and pretty general
in the navy, to allow the men one day
in the week for washing, when the weather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
and other circumstances will admit of it. It
would be a farther improvement in the rules
of the service to supply sope in the same
manner as tobacco and slops are supplied,
that is, to let the men have what quantity
they want from the purser, who is allowed
to charge it against their wages<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>.</p>

<p>Next to want of cleanliness, the circumstances
most apt to give rise to infection are,
close air and crowding. A certain length of
time is necessary, in order that these should
have this effect, and the longer they take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
place, the more certainly will infection be
produced, and it will be the more virulent<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>

<p>In order to admit air freely, the ports
should be kept open whenever the weather
will permit this to be done. The great objection
to free ventilation is the danger of
exposing men to the air in cold climates.
But it fortunately happens, that fire, while
it is the most effectual means of counteracting
the cold air, is also the best means of
promoting ventilation; for wherever there
is fire, there is a constant change of air taking
place by means of the draught to
which it gives occasion. This cannot be
done with safety and convenience in all parts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
of the ship; but frequent fires in the lower
parts of a ship will prove extremely salutary
by drying up the moisture, and producing a
change of air, and also in a cold climate by
the warmth it produces.</p>

<p>The hammocks and bedding should also
be aired by exposing them upon deck, especially
after the ports have been long shut in
consequence of bad weather. They cannot
be thoroughly aired unless they are unlashed;
and as this could not be conveniently done
daily in men of war, it might be done from
time to time by the different divisions in rotation<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>.
When the men come to sleep upon
them after these operations, they experience
the same agreeable sensations as from a
change of linen; and this must conduce to
health as well as pleasure, like all other natural
and moderate gratifications. It may
be farther remarked in favour of cleanliness,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
that it is not only directly conducive to
health, but is naturally connected with habits
of good order, sobriety, and other virtues.
The most cleanly men are always the
most decent and honest, and the most slovenly
and dirty are the most vicious and irregular.</p>

<p>A ship of war must have a much greater
number of men on board than what are necessary
to navigate her; for, besides the marines,
a great many hands are necessary to
man the great guns in time of action. For
this reason, there is a greater risque of the
inconveniences of overcrowding than in ships
intended for commerce, and therefore much
greater attention is necessary with regard to
ventilation and cleanliness. There is a piece
of management which tends also in some
measure to obviate the necessity of crowding.
This is to berth the watches alternately,
by which it is meant, that one half
of each watch should lie on different sides,
whereby they do not sleep so close, and are
not so much exposed to each other’s breath
and to the heat and effluvia of each other’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
bodies. This has the farther advantage of
preserving the trim of the ship.</p>

<p>What has been said of the ship and men
in general, applies still more strongly to the
sick, and the berth<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> assigned to them; for
there is nothing so apt to increase, and even
generate, contagion, as a number of sick
together, unless uncommon attention is
paid to cleanliness and ventilation. This is
so true, that, unless where the complaint is
very catching, it is best not to separate the
sick; for if they are a good set of men on
board, those who are confined by sickness
will be better nursed and tended by their
messmates than in a sick berth. But if the
state of infection renders separation necessary,
the best part for the accommodation
of the sick, in a ship of the line, is under
the forecastle in a warm climate, and on the
fore part of the main deck in a cold one.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
When they are under the forecastle, however,
they ought to occupy only one side,
as they would otherwise be disturbed by the
men who must pass to and from the head,
and the men in health would, in this case,
be exposed also to contagion. As infection
is most likely to arise among the sick, attention
to cleanliness and air is doubly requisite
where they lie; and it has a good effect to
sprinkle hot vinegar and diffuse its steams
among them once or twice a day.</p>

<p>Thus we see that cleanliness and discipline
are the indispensable and fundamental
means of health, without which every other
advantage and precaution is thrown away.
Government never bestowed more attention
and expence upon the victualling of the
navy than during the late war; but it would
be to little purpose to provide the most
nourishing and antiscorbutic diet, the most
wholesome and cordial wines, the most efficacious
remedies, and the most skilful physicians
and surgeons, if the men are not
constrained to keep their persons sweet,
their clothing and bedding clean, and their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
berths airy and dry. It is, therefore, upon
officers more than any others that the health
of the fleet depends; and I should be excused
in the frequent mention I make of
this, were it known how often I have been
the witness of the fatal effects of the neglect
of these rules.</p>

<h3 id="MEANS_OF_ERADICATING_INFECTION">3. Means of eradicating Infection.</h3>

<p>When, from a neglect of the means
above mentioned, an infectious fever comes
actually to prevail, and the infection, perhaps,
adheres obstinately to the ship in spite
of cleanliness, good air, and diet, and all the
other means, which, if employed in due
time, would have prevented it, then some
measures are to be taken for eradicating this
subtile poison.</p>

<p>The first step towards this is, to prevent
the disease from spreading, and this is done
by separating the sick from the healthy,
and cutting off all intercourse as much as
possible. For this end, it is necessary to
appropriate a particular berth to contagious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
complaints, and not only to prevent the
idle visits of men in health, but to discover
and separate the persons affected with
such complaints as soon as possible, both
to prevent them from being caught by
others, and because recent complaints are
most manageable and curable. Officers
might be very useful in making an early
discovery of complaints, by observing those
who droop and look ill in the course of
duty; for seamen think it unmanly to
complain, and have an aversion to be put on
the sick list. I have heard of a method
practised in some ships, of keeping a book
on the quarter deck for the officer to mark
the names of such men as might look ill,
or might be missed from duty upon calling
the roll, in order to afford the surgeon a
means of finding out those who should be
the objects of his care.</p>

<p>Those whose profession it is to superintend
the health of the ship, would find it for
their ease and interest, and should consider
it as their duty, to walk over the different
decks once a day, or every other day, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
order to make an early discovery of those
who may be taken ill. Though I have laid
great stress on the duty of the commander,
as the proper guardian of health, yet his
assiduity will not avail unless the surgeon
also does his part, by such acts of attention
as I have mentioned, joined to skill in his
profession.</p>

<p>Surgeons are, perhaps, more regarded in
our service than in that of other nations;
but it would be for the public benefit if they
were still more respected and encouraged.
To men of liberal education and sentiments,
as surgeons ought to be, and generally are,
the most effectual inducements for them to
do their duty are flattering attentions, and a
certain degree of estimation in the eyes of
their officers. Liberality of manners, on
the part of superiors, is the most likely
means of encouraging a conscientious performance
of duty in this profession; for
though strict and distant behaviour may operate
upon the minds of those whose functions
are merely mechanical, how can it infuse
that tender attention to human sufferings,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
and that sense of duty, which may
induce a man entrusted with the health and
lives of his fellow creatures to act his part
with propriety and effect?</p>

<p>In order to prevent sickness from spreading,
it is not sufficient to cut off all personal
intercourse. The clothes of men are
as dangerous a vehicle of infection as their
persons; and it should be a strict and invariable
rule in case of death from fever, flux,
or small pox, to throw overboard with the
body every article of clothing and bedding
belonging to it.</p>

<p>Upon the same principle, in case of recovery
from any contagious disease, as it
would be too great a waste to destroy the
clothes and beds, they should be smoked,
and then scrubbed or washed before the
men join their messes and return to duty.
This precaution is the more necessary, as
infection in a ship is extremely apt to be
communicated by bedding, from the custom
of stowing the hammocks in the netting,
by which they are brought in contact with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
each other. This, however, is an excellent
custom, as it not only clears the ship below,
and serves to form a barricade on the gunwale,
but tends to air the bedding; and
this salutary effect should not be prevented,
except in case of rain, by the coverings,
called hammock-cloths, by the use of which
utility is evidently sacrificed to an excess of
neatness.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that the number of
sick in a ship is so great, that it is not possible
to take proper and effectual measures on
board for stopping the progress of disease.
But when she can be cleared of the sick by
sending them to an hospital, no pains should
be spared to extirpate the remaining seeds of
infection.</p>

<p>For this purpose, let their clothing and
bedding be sent along with them; let their
hammocks, utensils, and whatever else they
leave behind, be smoked, and either scrubbed
or washed before they are used by other
men, or mixed with the ship’s stores; let
the decks, sides, and beams of their berths,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
be well washed, scraped, smoked, and dried
by fire; then let them be sprinkled with
hot vinegar, and, finally, white-washed all
over with quick lime.</p>

<p>Should any officer object to the trouble
and inconvenience of all this, let him reflect
for a moment how much more troublesome
and inconvenient, as well as noisome
and disagreeable, sickness itself proves
to be; let him reflect that the efficiency of
the ship, considered as a bulwark of defence,
or an engine of annoyance, depends on the
number of healthy hands, and that his own
character is to depend on the exertions to be
made by them in the day of battle, not to
mention the attention due from him as a man
to the sufferings of the objects themselves.</p>

<p>But besides these recent infections, it
sometimes happens that the seeds of disease
adhere to the timbers of a ship for
months and years together, and can be
eradicated only by a thorough cleansing and
fumigation. Sweeping, washing, scraping,
and airing, are not sufficient entirely to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
remove the subtile infectious matter; but
they will assist and will prepare it to be
acted upon by heat and smoke, which are
the only means to be depended upon. A
complete fumigation can only be performed
when the ship is in dock; and I shall here
transcribe a method recommended by Dr.
Lind.</p>

<p>“It will be proper to remove every
thing out of the ship, so that the hold
may be swept, and, when the men have
withdrawn, to light a number of charcoal
fires in different parts, and to throw
a handful or two of brimstone on each.
The steam of these should be closely confined
by shutting the ports and hatchways
from morning till evening, no person
in the mean time being allowed to
go below, nor for some time after opening
the ports and hatchways, that the
steam may be dispersed.</p>

<p>“In order to purify the men’s clothes,
it would farther be proper to fumigate
the hulk into which they are removed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
with tobacco once or twice a week while
their ship is in dock, the men remaining
below as long as they can bear it.</p>

<p>“The clothes and hammocks of the men
should be exposed in the hulk to the
smoke of the tobacco, and those which
are more particularly suspected may be
hung up the ship, and exposed to the
steam of the charcoal and brimstone.</p>

<p>“The ship having been already fumigated
with tobacco, it will be sufficient
to use the fumigation of charcoal and
brimstone above described for three days,
and, after the last day’s fumigation, the
inside of the ship should be well washed
with boiling vinegar, and, before the men
return on board, all the decks should be
scraped and washed.”</p>

<p>When a ship is at sea, these precautions
cannot be taken so completely; but if infection
is present, or is suspected, then
cleansing and fumigating may be practised
in a less degree. I have known a ship at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
sea fumigated with gunpowder kneaded with
vinegar, so as to prevent it from exploding,
and to make it burn slowly with a spattering
flame. Flowers of sulphur<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
about an eighth part of nitre, will answer
still better. A quantity of these is placed
in each interval of the guns between decks,
every person being turned up, and the ports
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
and hatches shut till they are consumed,
and till the smoke has dispersed. It has also
been recommended to burn resinous bodies,
such as the woods of fir, spruce, and juniper,
as the smoke of these is more salutary.
Upon the same principle, the effluvium of
tar is thought wholesome; and the cables
that are coiled in the lower parts of a
ship being soaked with tar, like most of the
other ropes of a ship, probably conduce to
the health of a place otherwise dank and
unwholesome. Fumigation may also be
performed by means of tar, either by throwing
it on red-hot irons, or a wood fire,
which may be carried about between decks
in a pot or moveable grate, or over some
cannon balls in a tub, or by immersing a
red-hot loggerhead<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> in a bucket of tar. If
this is done in the place occupied by the
sick, it will have a still better effect; and it
will be of service to them to be removed for
a short time under the half deck or forecastle
till this or other means of purification
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
are put in practice. In whatever manner
fumigation is performed, it will be of service
to spread out the clothes and bedding
of the men, or to hang them upon lines,
that they may be exposed to the heat and
smoke.</p>

<p>It will also be of great service to make
the men expose their frowsy clothes to the
sun and wind. If a strong infection is suspected,
and it cannot be afforded to destroy
the clothes, the best means of eradicating
the poison is to hang them for a length of
time over pots of burning brimstone in a
large cask standing endways, with small
apertures to admit air enough for the brimstone
to burn.</p>

<p>Fire in every shape is to be considered as
the principal agent of purification, by its
heat and the ventilation it occasions, perhaps,
still more than its smoke. It has already
been repeatedly inculcated, that the
great enemies of infection are ventilation
and heat. I have mentioned smoke and the
effluvia of balsamic bodies, but these are not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
to be depended on; and it is the more necessary
to mention this, as the attention bestowed
on more trifling means may divert the
mind from a proper regard to what is more
essential. It is mentioned by the benevolent
Mr Howard, that it is the custom in some parts
abroad to scatter fresh branches of pine or
spruce in the hospitals, in order to purify the
air; but, trusting to this, they neglect the
admission of fresh air, which is the only effectual
method of sweetening the air.</p>

<p>There is reason to think that the open
air very soon dissipates and renders inert all
infections of the volatile kind, and of course
the warmer the air is the more readily it
will have this effect. It is accordingly observed,
that infection is much less apt to be
generated about the persons of men, and that
it adheres to them for a much less space of
time in a hot climate than in a cold or temperate
one. This is a remark, which, so far
as I know, has not been made by any author;
and, till observation suggested it to
me, I fancied the reverse to be the truth.
I have seen so many instances of filth and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
crowding in ships and hospitals in the West
Indies, without contagion being produced,
and which in Europe could hardly have
failed to produce it, or to render it more
malignant, that I am convinced there is
something in tropical climates unfavourable
to the production and continuance of infectious
fevers<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>. The ships which bring this
fever from Europe in general get rid of it
soon after arriving in a warm climate; and
nothing but the highest degree of neglect
can continue or revive it.</p>

<p>The facts above mentioned brought into
my mind what is related of the plague at
Smyrna and other places, that it disappears
at the hottest part of the year. It is also
curious and important to remark, that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
true pestilence never has been heard of between
the tropics. It is not easy to assign
the cause of this effect of heat upon infection,
as every thing relating to this subject
is very obscure. We can conceive it to be
owing to the greater degree of airiness which
the heat of the climate makes necessary, or
to the use of fewer woollen clothes. There
may be something in the state of the body,
particularly in the pores of the skin, which
disposes them less to imbibe or produce the
poisonous effluvia, or, when imbibed, it
may more readily be thrown out by perspiration
with the other acrimony of the blood;
or more probably, as has been hinted above,
the virulent matter is of such a degree of volatility
as to be readily dissipated in a certain
degree of heat<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span></p>

<p>There is a fact, which, though seemingly
of a contrary tendency, yet is in reality in
proof of the same opinion. It is, that these
same diseases disappear in circumstances of
great cold. When England was last visited
by the plague, it disappeared in winter; and
the same is observed at Moscow and other
places. In this case the infectious matter is
rendered <i>inert</i>, but not <i>extinct</i>, and the return
of heat sets it afloat in the atmosphere,
so as to expose it to human respiration.
Dr. Guthrie informs us, that infection is
entangled and fixed by the cold of winter
on the doors and walls of the houses of the
Russian peasants, and that upon the return
of the warm season it is set loose by the
thaw, and then becoming active, produces
diseases.</p>

<p>With regard to the West Indies, the precautions
that have been laid down are chiefly
necessary when a ship newly arrives in the
climate; for it is during the first three or
four months that sickness is apt to prevail.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

<p>This does not depend upon any thing peculiar
to the climate; for I have known
ships arrive without being visited with any
sickness. It seems to be owing, for the
most part, to that flock of infection and
disease imported from Europe exerting its
effects, and when this has spent itself, the
men remain in good health, unless exposed
to the land air or other accidents; for the
air at sea in those climates, as well as every
where else, is extremely pure and wholesome,
and there is no where that seamen are
more healthy or comfortable.

<h3 id="CHAP_I_SECT_III">SECT. III.<br />

<span class="medium">Of the <span class="smcap">Foul Air</span> generated in a Ship.</span></h3>

<p>I mean here to distinguish the unwholesome
vapour produced by the contents of
the ship from the infection produced by the
effluvia of men’s persons, which was treated
of in the last section.</p>

<p>The means of preventing this foul air
from being generated are, cleanliness, dryness,
and ventilation.</p>

<p>All parts of a ship may, if neglected, become
dirty, and emit an offensive vapour;
but the parts under water consisting of the
orlop and hold, are more particularly so
from the materials they contain, and from
the want of free access to the fresh air; accordingly,
there is always more or less
stench in those parts, even in the best-regulated
ships.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

<p>It was mentioned in the first part of this
work, that an opinion was entertained by
some that no foul air was productive of fevers
but such as proceeds from the living
human body. I alledged that this was
otherwise, at least in hot climates; and
some proofs of this opinion were adduced,
particularly from the French prizes. Though
the neglect of personal cleanliness is the
principal source of disease, yet cleanliness of
every kind, and purity of the air in every
respect, is to be anxiously studied.</p>

<p>With regard to general cleanliness, it is
hardly necessary to mention sweeping, washing,
and scrubbing of the decks; for the
natural propensity of the English<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> nation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
to neatness seldom allows any neglect of
these. Lord Howe, to whose virtues as a
man, and abilities as an officer, his country
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
is so much indebted, gave it in general orders
to wash the upper decks every day, the
lower decks twice a week, and the orlop
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
once a week at least. He also ordered that,
every washing, smoking, mustering, and review
of clothes, or any other means taken
for the health of the ship, should be marked
in the logbook, and the reason to be assigned
there if omitted at the stated times.
These rules are a good specimen of the order
that ought to prevail in every branch of
public duty; for it is well known to every
experienced officer that it is a methodical
proceeding of this kind which can alone
render service either easy or effective.</p>

<p>The loss of men’s lives from the foul air
of the well is a common accident in ships,
and I have been myself witness to several
instances of it. Where there is the least
suspicion of this, a candle should previously
be let down, and if it should be extinguished,
it may be concluded that the air is
deadly. It becomes safe for men to breathe
in it by leaving it open for some time, or,
more expeditiously, by letting down fire in
a pot or grate, which soon changes the air,
by producing a draught of it upwards.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

<p>It is a very salutary practice to let down
fires frequently into the well, both in order
to purify the air and to dry the surrounding
parts. It was formerly mentioned that this
was daily done in the Intrepid, and the effect
of it was to remove the wetness of the
ballast and the mouldiness which had overspread
the sides and beams; and having had
the effect of sweetening and purifying the
air, it seemed to be the principal circumstance
that tended to make this ship extremely
healthy from being the most sickly of all
the fleet. This precaution, as well as every
other point of cleanliness, is more necessary
in large ships, because the mass of foul air,
as well as the quantity of corrupting materials,
is greater<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

<p>The following fact strongly evinces the
good effect of fire and smoke:&mdash;When it
was the custom for frigates to have their
kitchens between decks, they were much
more healthy than in the present construction,
in which they have them under the
forecastle, where the heat and smoke are
dissipated without being diffused through the
ship, and causing a draught of air upwards,
as formerly. The men derived then also
great benefit and comfort from having a
large fire, round which they might assemble
to warm and dry themselves in a sheltered
place. I leave it to those who preside
in the construction of the navy to determine
how far it would be advisable to return
to the old manner of construction.
The French ships of the line have their
kitchens and ovens between decks, and this
must tend to counteract the effects of their
want of cleanliness. The Dutch ships of
the line have their kitchens on the orlop
deck, which must be still more conducive
to the general purity of the air.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p>Moisture is pernicious both in itself and
as the instrument of putrefaction. All the
complaints, called colds, are more owing to
wet than cold; and moisture may be the
means of producing, or at least of exciting
dangerous fevers, when they would not
otherwise appear. It besides contributes
greatly to the production of scurvy. Ships
built of ill-seasoned wood are found to be
very unhealthy on account of the moisture
contained in it. The moisture of timber
arises not only from being used too soon
after being felled, but also, as I am informed,
from being stripped of its bark and
outer surface when piled and exposed to the
weather in dock yards. This method of
smoothing and piling the wood is only a
late practice; and the advantage in point
of convenience and neatness seems to be
more than overbalanced by the detriment it
thereby receives.</p>

<p>A wet hold diffuses moist vapour all over
the ship; and it was a rule with some of
those commanders whom I observed to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
most successful in preserving the health of
their men, not only to have daily fires in
the well, but to bail out the water when
the pumps could not exhaust it all, and never
to allow it to collect to more than the
depth of a few inches. It is, therefore,
very doubtful whether it is a good practice
to let in water, as is very commonly done
in order to sweeten the hold, for the same
sweetness will be preserved if it is kept
strictly dry. If it should happen, indeed, that
there should be a great deal of putrid matter
in the lower parts of the ship, from previous
neglect or unavoidable leakage, it may be adviseable
to let in a quantity of water in
order to loosen and wash off what is offensive,
and then to pump it out.</p>

<p>There is a circumstance in the first fitting
out of a ship well worth attention, as highly
conducive to the dryness and cleanness of
the hold. I mean the choice of the ballast;
for that which is called <i>shingle</i>, consisting all
of pebbles, is far preferable to that which is
sandy and earthy, as it does not so readily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
soak and retain the moisture and filth. Water
or fluid of any kind readily subsides in it,
and should any putrid matter be entangled
in it, there will be less difficulty in washing
it out.</p>

<p>The decks should not be washed so often
when the weather is moist as when it is
fine, as it will be more difficult to dry them,
and more harm may arise from the moisture
than benefit from the cleanness. Washing
should also be performed very early in the
morning, even in the best weather, in order
that there may be time for the decks to become
dry in the course of the day. It is
after a general washing that the moveable
fires, formerly described, are most proper
and useful.</p>

<p>Every contrivance should be fallen upon
to change the air in the orlop and hold.
Ventilators and windsails<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> are well adapted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
for this purpose, and should be used as frequently
and for as long a time as possible.
It has also a good effect in cooling the air in
the lower parts of a ship in the West Indies,
to lift the gratings of the hatches, raising
them on their edges, and lashing them to
the staunchions. It contributes likewise to
cleanliness and coolness to keep the decks as
clear as possible from<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> chests and other lumber,
which are in the way of sweeping and
washing, and prevent also the free course
of the air.</p>

<p>Particular attention to ventilation is necessary
in frigates, for almost all that part in
which the men sleep is excluded from the
air, and they are therefore very uncomfortable
in the West Indies unless small scuttles
are cut in the sides. But if this should be
objected to as weakening or endangering the
ship, there is a good contrivance for the same
purpose, which I met with on board of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
Nymphe frigate. It consists of a square
wooden pipe, of about nine inches in the
side coming from between decks, running
along the side of the ship, and opening over
the gunwale of the forecastle. There was
one on each side.

<span class="medium">Means of guarding against <span class="smcap">Infection</span> and
<span class="smcap">Bad Air</span>.</span></h3>

<p>Infection never prevails to such a degree,
as to affect every person indiscriminately
who is exposed to it. Even where the
plague and small-pox prevail to the greatest
degree, there are some persons who, though
susceptible of these diseases, yet escape them.
There are certain other infections of a weaker
nature, as was before observed, and these
will remain entirely inactive, till they find
constitutions so disposed as to be fit subjects
of their action. The seeds of disease may
be compared to those of vegetables, which
lye dormant, unless they happen to fall into
a situation peculiarly adapted for exciting
their activity. It is very difficult to account for
this uncertainty in the operation of infection,
but it is extremely providential, that under
the most calamitous state of sickness, there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
are always some who are in health and who
survive, for the necessary purposes of life.
If this were not the case, it might happen
that every person on board of a ship might
perish from sickness in the course of a voyage,
a circumstance which I believe has
never been known to happen.</p>

<p>There is an endless variety in the constitution
of the human frame, both in mind and
body, as well as in the features of the face.
There are, perhaps, no two individuals in
the world in whom the same effect precisely
is produced by the same food, air, medicine,
poison, or passions of the mind. The different
effects of infection, therefore, upon different
people, seem to depend, in many cases,
on peculiarities of constitution too obscure
to be explained; but there are also known
circumstances which resist or encourage its
effects.</p>

<p>The great power of habit<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> in taking off the
effect of infection, has already been mentioned,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
and it would appear that novelty gives
an increased energy and activity to all impressions,
as well as those on the senses. If
a person, therefore, escapes the first attack of
infection, he will be more likely to continue
exposed to it with safety in future.</p>

<p>There are certain precautions necessary
to be attended to by those who are unavoidably
exposed to contagion, particularly
in the first instance. Those who can afford
a full diet, and a liberal use of wine, have
been observed to resist infection better than
those who use food and drink that is meagre
and watery. It is also a good rule not to go
among the sick, nor otherwise to expose
one’s self to infectious air, with an empty
stomach; for whether it is that the body is
then more susceptible, or that the pores of
the skin and lungs are in a more highly absorbing
state, so as with greater readiness to
inhale the poison of disease, it is certain that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
a person in that situation is more apt to catch
harm from foul air of any kind. Whatever
else weakens and exhausts the body, renders
it also more susceptible of noxious impressions.
Under the head of weakening powers, I comprehend
not only what empties the body of
its fluids, such as loss of blood, or a diarrhœa,
but intoxication, fatigue, fasting, watching,
and certain affections of the mind, such as
care and grief.</p>

<p>Cold and moisture may also be enumerated
among the causes that invite the attack of
infectious diseases. They are of themselves
simply productive of catarrhs, rheumatisms,
and the like disorders; but if an infection
should be accidentally present when the body
is exposed to them, then instead of these
complaints, the disease peculiar to that infection
will be produced<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>. This was illustrated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
in the last reinforcement we had from
England; for while bad fevers were breaking
out in most of the other ships, the <a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>Union
was affected with those complaints only
which are simply the effects of cold and
moisture. It would be more proper, perhaps,
to say, <i>exposure to the air</i>, than to
call it <i>cold</i>; for exposing the naked body to
the open air, even in the warmest climate,
is prejudicial to health. This holds at least
with regard to Europeans who are accustomed
to clothing, however the natives of hot
climates who are naked, may expose themselves
with impunity.</p>

<p>It is of the greatest consequence to ascertain
the extent of the influence of infection,
for the means of avoiding and preventing it
will very much depend upon this. It is
now known, that infection extends itself to
a very small distance. There are, indeed,
some morbid poisons, such as that of the
bite of a mad dog, and that of the venereal
disease, which require actual contact to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
make them take effect. Others are more
volatile, and seem to he inhaled by the
breath, or absorbed by the skin, but these
do not extend far. That of the plague<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>
does not reach above a few yards, and that
of the small-pox and of fevers is probably
equally limited. This discovery is very valuable,
by ascertaining the limits of danger;
for when a person imagines he runs the same
risk when at a considerable distance from the
seat of disease, as if he were in contact with
the person affected, he will be apt to expose
himself wantonly and unnecessarily to the
infection.</p>

<p>It seems to be owing to the ignorance of
the extent of its influence, that the plague
has in general been so fatal; for in consequence
of the opinion that the whole surrounding
atmosphere was affected, it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
vainly attempted to purify it by large fires
in the open air, or by <a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>firing off artillery, instead
of trusting to the separation of the sick
so as to avoid their near approach, and to
the confinement of those in health to their
own houses, which are all the precautions
necessary to prevent its progress.

<h3 id="SECT_I_of_Solid_Food">SECT. I. Of <span class="smcap">Solid Food</span>.</h3>

<p>The most unnatural circumstance in a
sea life is the food which men use, and the
disease most peculiar to it is one which is
owing chiefly to the nature of the aliment;
for though other causes conspire in aggravating
the scurvy, the depraved state of the
<small>INGESTA</small> is the main and fundamental cause
of it.</p>

<p>It is this disease that is most fatal to seamen
next to fevers. It was formerly as fatal,
if not more so; but some modern improvements
have rendered it less frequent
and violent. The habitual use of salt provisions,
besides producing evident symptoms
of scurvy, begets such a state of the constitution,
that, upon the least scratch being received,
particularly on the lower extremities,
a large and incurable ulcer ensues; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
this circumstance, trifling as it appears, is
the cause of losing an incredible number of
men to the service, especially in the West
Indies. The greater part of the food of a
ship’s company is necessarily salted meat.
Biscuit and pease, though of a vegetable
nature, are hard of digestion; and though
they qualify the animal food, they do not
answer the purpose of fresh vegetables.
Though officers have a supply of live stock
even for the longest voyages, it would be
impracticable to carry a quantity sufficient
to preserve a whole crew from the scurvy.
But certain articles have of late been introduced
into use, of a durable and portable nature,
which so qualify the salt provisions,
that they can be used without inducing this
disease. These are either such as are articles
of common diet, viz. melasses and sour
krout, or those which are intended only for
the sick and recovering, such as portable
soup and the preserved juice of lemons and
oranges.</p>

<p>It is one of the most ancient and real
grievances in the service, that there has not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
been a sufficiently ample supply of nourishment
and cordials for the weak and recovering.
This complaint is made by <a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>Dr. Cockburn,
who was physician to the fleet in the
end of the last century; and it is a complaint
that has not yet been entirely redressed, nor
has the subject been considered with the attention
it deserves. The only improvement in
the sea victualling that I know of from that
time till of late, has been the use of raisins
for puddings, and the occasional use of vinegar,
which is an article extremely salutary,
and was looked upon as the great preservative
of health in the Roman armies.</p>

<p>After the force of disease has been subdued
at sea, men are frequently lost by relapses,
or pine away in dropsies and other
chronic complaints, for want of being supported
by some cordial and nourishing diet.
It is mentioned in my memorial to the Admiralty,
how insufficient the small quantity
of surgeon’s necessaries are; and it is recommended
that a large quantity of certain species
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
of refreshment should be put in the
purser’s charge, which, being substituted for
the common sea victualling while men are
ill or recovering, would cost Government
little or nothing. Besides the articles already
mentioned, it was recommended to
set apart a quantity of the best wines, and
to be provided with brown sugar, dried
fruits, barley, rice, sago, and salep. To
these might be added eggs, which, if greased
and put in salt, may be preserved fresh for a
great length of time. Carrots and other roots
might also be preserved for the longest voyages
by means of sugar; and green vegetables
might in like manner be preserved by
means of salt. But of all the articles, either
of medicine or diet, for the cure of the
scurvy, lemons and oranges<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> are of much
the greatest efficacy. They are real specifics
in that disease, if any thing deserves that
name. This was first ascertained and set in
a clear light by Dr. Lind. Upon what
principle their superior efficacy depends, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
in what manner they produce their effect, I
am at a loss to determine, never having been
able to satisfy my mind with any theory
concerning the nature and cure of this disease,
nor hardly indeed of any other. An
ingenious treatise has been published on this
subject by Dr. Milman, to which I refer the
reader, meaning to confine myself in this
work chiefly to what is practical.</p>

<p>Every person who has beheld with attention
and feeling the tedious and languishing
series of suffering which the sick and recovering
endure for want of the means of supporting
and recruiting their strength and
spirits, must wish that those who preside
in the civil department of the navy would
seriously consider this subject, and complete
the reform that has already been begun.</p>

<p>With regard to the victualling of men in
health, a most commendable attention has
been paid to the improvement of it. The
ordinary articles of victualling have not only
been of excellent quality, but some new articles
have been added, from which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
greatest benefit has been derived. The
chief of these are sour krout and melasses.
The latter was first brought into use by
Captain Ferguson in the beginning of the
late war. He ordered it to be served with
rice to the men who were affected, or threatened
with the scurvy, in the ship under his
command. The benefit experienced from it
in this and other instances was so great,
that during the last two years of the war it
was made a regular article of sea victualling,
and substituted in place of a certain proportion
of oatmeal<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span></p>

<p>As bread is one of the principal articles
of diet, the utmost care should be taken in
preserving it, and great advantage would
arise from stowing it in casks that are water
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
tight, instead of keeping it in bags, or letting
it lie loose in the bread room. Captain
Cook, by this method, and by giving it a
cast in the oven in the course of the voyage,
preserved his biscuit found in every respect
for more than three years. But the greatest
improvement in this article of diet would be
to have, in the form of flour, a greater proportion
of what is now allowed in bread.
The flour might be made into puddings,
and seems, in this form, to be more nutritious
and antiscorbutic than biscuit which
has undergone a strong force of fire. This
sort of mess would be still more proper and
agreeable now that melasses is a stated article
of diet. Flour, by being well pressed
and rammed, will keep as long as biscuit,
and it can be stowed in one fifth part of the
space; it will, therefore, cost much less in
freight than the same quantity of it in that
form, and it may be baked abroad if necessary<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>.
Malt, by being well rammed, may
also be preserved for a great length of time.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p>Of all the former articles of sea victualling,
there was none more abused than oatmeal.
The quantity allowed to each man
was twice as much as he could consume,
and the overplus went to the purser’s profits,
or was wasted by being given to the hogs,
or even wantonly thrown overboard. Melasses
have, with great advantage, been substituted
for part of it, in the proportion of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
eleven pounds for two gallons of oatmeal.
The first trial of melasses was in the<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> Foudroyant,
and it answered so well, that, in a
cruise under Admiral Geary in 1780, this
was the only ship free from the scurvy, and
out of two thousand four hundred men that
were landed at the hospital with this disease,
there were none from this ship. It
appears to be so similar in its nature and effects
to essence of malt, that it seems hardly
worth while for Government to be at the
expence of providing the latter.</p>

<p>A certain proportion of barley has also of
late been substituted for part of the oatmeal,
which being more light and palatable, makes
a pleasing variety, particularly to the sick
and recovering. Captain Cook carried wheat
with him, and found it to answer equally
well. Might not potatoes also be a proper
and salutary substitute, as they will keep a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
considerable length of time in a warm climate,
and they have been successfully employed
in their raw state for the cure of
scurvy? It would not be right, however, to
abolish oatmeal entirely; for there is a certain
preparation of it which is an antiscorbutic
of equal efficacy with any whatever, except
the juice of lemons and oranges. This
is flummery, or sowins, which is prepared by
letting oatmeal and water stand together till
they grow acidulous, and then boiling them
into a jelly. I know of some well-attested
instances of the crews of ships being saved
from the scurvy by this alone.</p>

<p>Butter is a good article of victualling in
so far as it renders that part of the diet
which consists of grain and vegetables more
palatable, and thereby induces men to eat
more. But as it is extremely corruptible in
a warm climate, hardly any being used by
the seamen but what is more or less rancid,
it should never be sent to a tropical station.
Greater quantities of it are condemned than
of any other article of victualling, and it is
therefore the most expensive to Government.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
There are certain articles that are the natural
produce of the West-India islands, which
may be substituted for it with the greatest
advantage. These are sugar and cocoa<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>,
which, during the last year of the war, were
served in place of butter with great success,
and this proved an alteration in diet not
only salutary, but agreeable to the seamen,
whose inclinations are always to be consulted
in such changes<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>When a ship is in port, encouragement
should be given to the sale of roots, greens,
fruits, and sugar. The men have a good
custom of exchanging part of their bread,
beef, and pork, for what they can get from
the shore; but as they in general prefer spirituous
liquors to the above-mentioned articles,
the greatest care and vigilance should
be used to preclude men from such opportunities
of injuring themselves<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>. Every
ship should be furnished with a seine, and
other implements for fishing, when in harbour.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

<p>When captures are made, in which there
are such articles as sugar, wine, rice, or
fruits, it would be much better in many
cases to allow the immediate use of them at
sea, where the men may be disposed to
scurvy or other diseases, than to wait for
the conversion of them into money.</p>

<p>Though it has been my object to introduce
as many articles of diet as possible, independent
of salt provisions, it does not follow
that these are in themselves unwholesome.
They are pernicious by being made
almost the sole and exclusive article; but if
used in moderate quantity, they are even in
some respects well adapted for the food of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
seamen. The nature of their life gives them
a strong digestion: in their duties they not
only employ violent exercise, but use more
muscles and a greater variety of postures
and motions than men of any other profession.
To such constitutions may not food
of a refractory nature and hard of digestion
have even an advantage over what is more
delicate and digestible?</p>

<p>It does not appear that it is the salt quality
of the provisions used at sea that makes
them productive of scurvy, but the want of
their native juices and of the nutritious
principle. A small quantity of salt is necessary
to make all food palatable and wholesome,
in so much that it is reckoned one of
the necessaries of life. All animals have a
craving for sea salt, and nature has kindly
made it the most abundant and universal of
all saline bodies. Food, without this seasoning,
not only comes to be loathed, but
the want of it renders the animal weak and
flabby. As it not only assists digestion,
but invigorates all the bodily functions by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
stimulating and bracing the fibres, it is in
some cases a valuable medicine. It is remarkable
that men are very apt to tire of a
long continuance of fresh provisions<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>, but
never of what is salt; and even under the
scurvy the latter will be relished, and sometimes
preferred to most other kinds of food.
It has been a practice with some to make
the scorbutic men drink sea water; but
though it is not attended with any manifest
benefit, I never heard that it aggravated the
disease.</p>

<p>I was told by the gentlemen of the army
at New York in 1780, that the soldiers in
cantonments were not near so subject to
agues as the people of the country; and the
only difference in their mode of life was, that
the former had in their allowance a certain,
proportion of salt provisions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>In an unhealthy country I should think a
free use of salt, as well as spice<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>, would be
salutary; and when ships are in port it would
perhaps be better to allow a certain proportion
of salt provisions, because it would not
only be wholesome and agreeable, but the
men’s constitutions would probably be more
reconciled to an entire salt diet when necessary:
but I would except from this the
crews of such ships as have newly arrived
from a long cruise or voyage, in which it
may be necessary to alter the constitution as
quickly as possible by a diet entirely fresh.</p>

<p>Nothing that I have collected from my
own observation, or that of others, has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
neglected under this head, except one particular
caution with regard to the preparation
of the victuals. The large utensils employed
to boil the provisions are made of
copper, and it sometimes happens from neglect
that these are allowed to contract a rust,
which is one of the most active poisons we
know. The neglect consists chiefly in allowing
any thing acid, or what is liable to
become acid, such as gruel or burgoo, to remain
for a length of time without being
washed out; for when victuals have been
prepared in the boilers thus uncleaned, they
produce the most violent effects, even to the
loss of life, as once happened in a ship belonging
to our fleet<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span></p>

<h3 id="SECT_II_of_Drink">SECT. II. Of <span class="smcap">Drink</span>.</h3>

<p>As the solid part of sea diet is very dry
and hard, and as the salt it contains is apt
to excite thirst, a freer use of liquids than
at land is necessary, particularly in a hot
climate.</p>

<p>It has been the custom, as far back as we
know, to allow seamen the use of some sort
of fermented liquor. We need hardly inquire
if this is salutary or not; for it would
be impossible at any rate to withhold it,
since it is an article of luxury, and a gratification
which the men would claim as their
right. There is a great propensity in seamen
to intoxicating liquors, which is probably
owing to the hardships they undergo,
and to the variety and irregularity of a sea
life. But there is reason to think that all
sorts of fermented liquors, except distilled
spirits, are conducive to health at sea.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that malt liquor is extremely
wholesome and antiscorbutic. The
common quantity of small beer allowed
daily is so liberal, that few men make use of
their whole allowance; and there is no objection
to the constant use of it, except that
it is apt to spoil in the course of a few weeks,
and that upon foreign stations the stock can
seldom be renewed. One of the greatest
improvements that could be made in the
victualling of the navy would be the introduction
of porter<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>, which can be preserved
in any climate for any length of time that
may be necessary.</p>

<p>Spruce beer seems to possess similar and
equal virtues with malt liquor and it has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
this advantage, that the materials of it can
at all times be carried about and used occasionally.
It agrees with malt liquor in being
a fermented vegetable sweet, the principal
ingredient of it being melasses. The other
ingredient, from which it takes its name,
being a balsamic substance, seems to be more
medicinal and antiscorbutic than hops, and
is therefore, perhaps, preferable to malt liquor.
There have been sufficient proofs of
its virtues in single ships; and all the men
of war that go to America and the West
Indies might be conveniently supplied with
it. Admiral Pigot provided a sufficient
quantity for the whole fleet; but the peace
coming on prevented the trial of it.</p>

<p>The most salutary kind of drink next to
malt liquor, and spruce beer, is wine. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
benefit which the fleet derived from it at different
times, and the advantage it has over
spirits has been often taken notice of in
the former part of this work. It seems to
be owing to this that the French fleet sometimes
enjoys superior health to ours, and is
less subject to the scurvy<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>. Wine is also
preferable to every other medicine in that
low fever with which ships are so much infested;
and there is no cordial equal to good
wine in recruiting men who are recovering.</p>

<p>Spirits differ from wine in this respect,
that they are a mere chemical liquor, incapable
of assimilation with our fluids, having
lost in distillation the native vegetable
principle in which the whole of its nutritious
quality and great part of its medical
virtue resides.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span></p>

<p>The abuse of spirituous liquors is extremely
pernicious every where, both as an
interruption to duty, and as it is injurious to
health. It is particularly so in the West
Indies, both because the rum is of a bad
and unwholesome quality, and because this
species of debauchery is more hurtful in a
hot than in a cold climate.</p>

<p>It is with reason that the new rum is accused
of being more unwholesome than
what is old; for, being long kept, it not
only becomes weaker and more mellow by
part of the spirit exhaling, but time is allowed
for the evaporation of a certain nauseous
empyreumatic principle which comes
over in the distillation, and which is very
offensive to the stomach; therefore, though
this is the produce of the West-India islands,
yet what is supplied there is inferior to that
which is brought from England.</p>

<p>It was originally the custom to serve seamen
with their allowance of spirits undiluted.
The method now in use, of adding
water to it, was first introduced by Admiral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
Vernon in the year 1740, and got the name
of <i>grog</i>. This was a great improvement;
for the quantity of half a pint, which is
the daily legal allowance to each man, will
intoxicate most people to a considerable degree,
if taken at once in a pure state.</p>

<p>The superiority of wine over spirits in
any shape was so conspicuous, that towards
the end of the war the fleets in the West
Indies and North America were supplied
with nothing but wine, and with a success
sufficient to encourage the continuance of
the same practice in future.</p>

<h4 id="OF_WATER">Of <span class="smcap">Water</span>.</h4>

<p>As water is a necessary of life, and as the
health and comfort of men at sea depend
upon its quality, it deserves particular attention.</p>

<p>Spring water is to be preferred to running
or stagnated water; for, unless it is taken
at the source, or near it, it is apt to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
impregnated with decayed vegetable and
animal substances, such as leaves, grass,
wood, and dead insects. This inconvenience
is greatest in a hot climate, where every
thing teems with life, and where the materials
of putrefaction are both more abundant
and more prone to corruption. This is the
most pernicious kind of impurity; for the
mineral impregnations common in springs
are seldom, in any degree, unwholesome, and
do not tend, like the other, to make the water
corrupt. At many of the West-India
watering places the water is found stagnated
just above high-water mark; and care should
be taken to go higher up to take it where it
is running.</p>

<p>The purest water is apt to spoil by producing
a putrid glare upon the inner surface
of the cask which contains it. There is a
great difference in this respect between a
new cask, especially if made of moist wood,
and that cask which has been hardened and
seasoned by age and use. Several contrivances
have been proposed for preparing the
vessels that hold the water; but none have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
been found by experience so effectual as letting
them stand for some time full of sea
water; and it is a great advantage of this
method, that it is so easily practicable.</p>

<p>It is in few places we meet with water
such as that of Bristol, which, in clean vessels,
may be kept for any length of time.
We may consider all water kept in wooden
vessels as more or less liable to putrefaction;
but there is a substance, which is neither
rare nor costly, that effectually preserves it
sweet. This is <i>quick lime</i>, with which every
ship should be provided, in order to put a
pint of it into each butt when it is filled.
It has the advantage of not being injurious
to health; but, on the contrary, is rather
friendly to the bowels, tending to prevent
and check fluxes. In the year 1779 several
ships of the line arrived in the West Indies
from England, and they were all afflicted
with the flux, except the Stirling Castle,
which was the only ship in which quick
lime was put into the water. Nor does it
spoil the water for any culinary purpose.
Its action in preventing putrefaction consists,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
in part at least, in destroying vegetable
and animal life. An addition of putrescent
matter is produced in water by the generation
of small insects; and the glare that
collects on the sides of casks, and also what
collects on the surface of the water, is a
species of vegetation of the order called by
naturalists <i>alg&aelig;</i><a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>. Quick lime is a poison
to this species of vegetable life as well as to
insects: but upon whatever principle it depends,
the property of it in preserving water
sweet is so well ascertained, that it is inexcusable
ever to neglect the use of it.</p>

<p>Quick lime is equally efficacious for this
purpose, whether slacked or unslacked; and
though the latter form is more convenient
for stowage, by having less weight and
bulk, yet the other is to be preferred for the
sake of safety; for if water should by chance
reach the unslacked lime, a great degree of
heat is thereby produced, which has been
known to give occasion to the most formidable
accidents.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<p>The only other objection I know of to
the use of quick lime is, that it converts
the water into a lime water, rendering it
thereby disagreeable to the palate and stomach:
but the quantity necessary to preserve
it makes but a very weak lime water;
for part of the lime is precipitated by the
mephitic air, or the aerial acid, as it is
otherwise called, of which there is some
contained in the water. The accidental exposure
to the atmosphere, which also abounds
with this sort of air, tends farther to lessen
the acrimony of the quick lime<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>.</p>

<p>There are other substances which have
been found useful in correcting bad water.
Alum and cream of tartar, as antiseptic bodies,
have been employed for this purpose.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
Vinegar and the vegetable acid juices and
fruits, such as tamarinds, may be used occasionally
to take off the putrid offensive
taste which may have arisen in case the use
of quick lime has been neglected. In the
fleet under Sir Charles Saunders, the water
of the river St. Lawrence having been found
to produce fluxes, this quality was removed
by throwing four pounds of burnt biscuit
into each cask before it was used. But there
is nothing so effectual, and subject to so few
inconveniences, as quick lime.</p>

<p>The next method to be mentioned of purifying
water is filtration, which not only
separates the gross impurities, but removes
the putrid smell and taste. It is performed
with a dripping stone, which is a convenient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
contrivance for officers, but cannot furnish
a supply for a whole ship’s company.</p>

<p>When the water of wells or brooks is
found loaded with mud, the following expeditious
method of filtration, described by
Dr. Lind, has been practised with success:&mdash;Let
a quantity of clean sand or gravel be
put into a barrel placed on one end, without
the head, so as to fill one half or more of
it, and let another barrel, with both ends
knocked out, of a much smaller size, (or
let it be an open cylinder of any kind) be
placed erect in the middle of it, and almost
filled with sand or gravel. If the impure
water be poured into the small barrel or
cylinder, it will rise up through the sand
of both barrels, and appear pure above the
sand of the large one in the interval between
it and the small one.</p>

<p>But when water is offensive in consequence
of being long kept, the most effectual and
expeditious method of sweetening it is by
exposing it to the air in as divided a state as
possible. Boiling will not expel the putrid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
effluvia contained in water; but such is the
attraction of air for this offensive matter,
that the water need only be thoroughly exposed
to it to be rendered quite sweet. This
is best done by a machine invented by Mr.
Osbridge, a lieutenant of the navy. It consists
of a hand pump, which is inserted in a
scuttle made at the top of a cask, and by
means of it the water, being raised a few
feet, falls through several sheets of tin
pierced like cullenders, and placed horizontally
in a half cylinder of the same metal.
The purpose of it is to reduce the water
into numberless drops, which being exposed
in this form to the open air, is deprived of
its offensive quality. The same method will
serve to separate the superfluous quick lime
in the water. It is a machine very deservedly
in common use, and the working of it is
a moderate and salutary exercise to men in
fair weather.</p>

<p>The following contrivance will be found
to afford a sufficient supply of sweet water
to particular messes, and may be considered
as an artificial and more expeditious sort of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
dripping stone.&mdash;Let the narrow mouth of
a large funnel be filled with a bit of sponge,
over which let there be a layer of clean gravel
or sand covered with a piece of flannel,
and over the whole another layer of sand.
Muddy or offensive water being poured upon
this, runs or drops out clear; and care must
be taken to change the sand, sponge, &amp;c.
frequently, as they will become loaded with
the impurities of the water<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>.</p>

<p>There should be in every ship an apparatus
for distilling water in case of distress.
This consists merely of a head and worm
adapted to the common boiler, and distillation
may go on while the victuals are boiling.
More than eight gallons of excellent
fresh water may be drawn off in an hour
from the copper of the smallest ship of
war<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>. I refer for a more particular account
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
of all this to the works of Dr. Lind, who
was the original inventor and recommender
of this method.</p>

<p>This invention seems to have escaped
others so long, from the idea that the <i>desideratum</i>
in freshening sea water was some
substance to be added to it while under distillation.
No such substance is necessary,
and, the more simple the mode of distillation,
the fresher the water will prove.</p>

<p>Rain water at sea is always pure and
wholesome, and may be saved occasionally
by means of a sail or awning.

<h2 id="PART_II_CHAP_III">CHAP. III.</h2>

<h3 id="OF_CLOTHING">Of <span class="smcap">Clothing</span>.</h3>

<p>Nature has made man so defenceless,
that even the rudest nations, in the hottest
climates, in general, adopt some sort of covering
to guard themselves from the weather.
We may affirm, that clothing is the
most artificial circumstance in the life of
man; and there is none, of which the
errors subject him to more inconvenience
and hardship. Insensible perspiration is performed
by the pores of the skin, and being
one of the most important functions of the
body, the suppression of it seems to be one
of the principal causes, or at least one of
the most frequent attendants on feverish and
inflammatory complaints; and one of the
most common causes of this suppression is
the application of cold to the skin.</p>

<p>In order to keep up perspiration, it is necessary
that the orifices of the pores of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
skin should be bathed, as it were, in the vapour
already secreted from them; and clothing
seems to act in confining this, as well
as in preventing the escape of the natural
heat and the access of the external air.
Though the air should not be cold, it will
check perspiration by carrying off this vapour
and drying the skin. In the warmest
climates exposure of the skin to the external
air is unsafe; for it not only produces a
feverish and uneasy sensation at the time,
but occasions the most dangerous internal
disorders. In consequence of the great sensibility
and sympathy of the body, and from
the pores of the skin being open in a warm
climate, exposure is in some respects even
more dangerous than in a cold one. Nothing
is more apt to bring on the locked
jaw and tetanus than sleeping in the open
air; and it was observed in Jamaica, that
when it was the custom to wear cotton and
linen clothes, the dry belly-ache was much
more common than now that it is the custom
to wear woollen cloth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<p>We know besides, that the pores of the
skin can absorb not only the moisture that
floats in the atmosphere, but a variety of
foreign bodies, whether noxious or medicinal,
which may be applied to their orifices;
and as the air is in certain places loaded
with noxious matter, may not clothing be
considered as a filter, as it were, to separate
the impurities of the air before it comes in
contact with the surface of the body?</p>

<p>It is therefore every where of the utmost
consequence that sufficient and suitable clothing
should be provided.</p>

<p>It would certainly be for the benefit of
the service that an uniform should be established
for the common men as well as for
the officers. This would oblige them at all
times to have in their possession a quantity
of decent apparel, subject to the inspection
of their superiors. It would also be less easy
to dispose of their clothes for money without
detection, and desertion would also
thereby be rendered more difficult.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span></p>

<p>It is of great consequence that the purser
should lay in a sufficient stock of clothing
and bedding suited to the climate for which
the ship is destined, in order that there may
be a sufficient supply after having been on a
distant station for a certain length of time.
I have known men suffer the greatest inconvenience
and hardship, and infectious diseases
kept up, from the neglect of this.</p>

<p>The greatest evil connected with clothing
is the infection generated by wearing it too
long without shifting; for to this cause we
have attributed the jail, hospital, or ship fever.
The great importance of cleanliness appeared
when we were treating of infection, from
whence we may judge of what consequence
it is that men should be provided with a
shift of linen, as that part of the clothing
which is in contact with the skin is most
likely to harbour infection<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span></p>

<p>As clothing is not the gift of nature, being
left to man’s own reason, it is subject to
caprice, and thereby productive of inconvenience
and disease. The necessity of it depends
very much upon habit, like every
thing else relating to the human body, and
therefore sudden and unseasonable changes
of apparel are very unsafe to health. It is
also found that a partial exposure of the
body is more pernicious than a general exposure.
If I were writing for the more delicate
part of the world, I should illustrate
this by the danger of exposing the feet alone
to cold or wet. It is seldom that seamen
are susceptible to so great a degree, for their
hardy and exposed life steels them against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
such impressions. But there is another circumstance
which renders it of the utmost
consequence to defend the feet against external
injury. It frequently happens, that, without
any visible symptoms of scurvy, the constitutions
of seamen are such, that, upon the
least scratch being received on the feet or
legs, a large spreading incurable ulcer arises;
which sometimes ends in the loss of a limb;
but at any rate disables them from duty till
a cure can be effected by the use of a fresh
and vegetable diet, or a change of climate.
Next to acute diseases and scurvy, this is the
most destructive complaint incident to a sea
life, particularly in a hot climate; and I
have known great numbers of good men
thereby lost to the service. It is, therefore,
of the utmost consequence that men should
not only be supplied with shoes, but be
obliged to wear them, which is found to
require a degree of compulsion; for in the
West Indies it is observed that seamen always
wish to go barefooted.</p>

<p>Since the first edition of this work was
published, I have been favoured with several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
valuable remarks on this subject, by Captain
Caldwell, an officer of great humanity and
experience. Among other remarks, he observes,
that the different articles of clothing
supplied to sailors are, in general, too slight,
and of too small a size, which renders them
expensive and inconvenient to large men.
The trowsers, he observes, should be much
thicker, and larger, as the least shower goes
through them; and, in a cold climate,
those made of <i>fear-nought</i><a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>, which do not
cost more than the others, should also be
allowed. What a situation are men in
when topsails are reefing in the winter
season while it rains, when cold and wet,
with their trowsers sticking to them, (which
would not be the case if they were of
flannel) and it is not practicable that they
should have change of clothing for every
time they are obliged to be wet? Thick,
double-milled caps are much wanted in bad
weather to cover the head and ears. Dutch
caps do not keep out the weather, and will
not stay on the head. It is commonly remarked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
that the men who wear the thickest
linen shirts are the most healthy.</p>

<p>Men, upon first entering into the service,
are allowed the advance of two months
wages, in order to provide necessaries: but
this, inadequate as it is for a long voyage,
is not extended to pressed men. It is also
argued against making large stoppages in
seamen’s wages; that, by diminishing what
they have to receive when paid off, a discouragement
is thereby given to the service.
But as we see men deserting from men of
war when several years wages are due to
them, the most reasonable and effectual encouragement
seems to be to render their
lives as comfortable and healthy as possible.</p>

<p>But why might not most of the articles
mentioned be supplied gratuitously? In favour
of which Captain Caldwell makes use
of an argument frequently inculcated in
this work, viz. that so much advantage
would accrue to Government by preserving
the health and lives of men, and so much
would be saved in hospitals, as would much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
more than reimburse the extraordinary expence<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

<h2 id="PART_II_CHAP_IV">CHAP. IV.</h2>

<h3 id="OF_EXERCISE">Of <span class="smcap">Exercise</span>.</h3>

<p>It commonly happens in a ship of war
that a great proportion of the hands is
landsmen; for, besides the men required to
navigate the ship, a great number is necessary
to fight the guns, as well as for other
duties, and their health may be affected by
the want of exercise.</p>

<p>It has been observed before, that one use
of frequent reviews and musters in a numerous
crew is, to call forth men that would
otherwise be overlooked, to oblige them to
come into the open air, to keep themselves
clean, and to prevent them from indulging
in filth and laziness. It is observed, that
seamen are in general less subject to scurvy
than marines and landsmen, which seems to
be owing to the greater activity of their life
and alacrity of their minds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<p>There is an essay on the causes of the pestilence,
by an anonymous author, published
at Edinburgh in 1759, in which this disease
is said to be entirely the offspring of idleness,
and he illustrates this by its being more apt to
arise in besieged towns than any other situation;
and he alledges that a false alarm of
the plague will actually produce it by throwing
people idle, as was the case, he affirms,
when the plague was last at Messina.</p>

<p>There are always numbers who have been
pressed into the service, to whom a sea life
is new, and who are therefore prone to indolence,
low spirits, and self-neglect. Men
of this description are by far the most apt to
fall into the scurvy; and next to the quality
of the food, there is nothing contributes
more to promote the scurvy than such a disposition.
It is indeed both a cause and a
symptom of this disease, and therefore idleness
and <i>skulking</i> should be rigidly discouraged,
unless the complaint is so far advanced
as to render it cruel and even impossible
to force men to take exercise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span></p>

<p>The Conqueror, of 74 guns, one of our
squadron in the last year of the war, was
an instance of a ship in which only the
prime seamen were attacked with the scurvy,
and this is to be accounted for upon the
same principle, for it proceeded from their
having been exempted from the duty of
pumping, in which the inferior classes of
men were constantly employed, owing to
the leaky state of the ship.</p>

<p>As low spirits and indolence have such an
unfavourable effect upon health, it would be
wise, as well as benevolent, to promote whatever
produces jollity, contentment, and good
humour, so far as is consistent with sobriety
and regularity. There are certain rough
sports which are now almost in disuse; and
whoever would revive and encourage them,
would perform a useful office to the service.</p>

<p>A sea life frequently demands violent
temporary exertions, from the uncertainty
of the weather, and other incidents; so that
men are more exposed to extreme fatigue
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
and sudden calls of duty in this than in any
other situation of life. Nothing tends more
to shorten life than excessive bodily labour
and watching; and it is for this reason that
seamen in general are short lived, and that
their countenance and general appearance
make them appear older than they really
are by several years. This is remarkably
the case when a seaman comes to be upwards
of forty and it has been mentioned
before, that a person not acquainted with
this circumstance will make a mistake of
ten years in guessing at the age of a seaman
from his looks.</p>

<p>Fatigue being therefore frequently the
means of bringing on disease and breaking
the constitution, as much tenderness is due
to men as is consistent with the necessary
duties of service. This is a circumstance
in which young officers are apt to forget
themselves; and they should take care how
they <i>call all hands</i> wantonly, and oblige men
to make exertions beyond their strength,
especially as this will be submitted to more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
readily by sailors than any other set of men,
from the generous alacrity of their nature.</p>

<p>It would be well if it could be rendered
convenient at all times, except in cases of
danger or emergency, to put the men at
three watches instead of watch and watch.
By the former arrangement they have eight
hours sleep and rest; by the latter only four
hours are allowed, which is not sufficient
for refreshment, nor is there time for them
to get dry, in case they have been exposed
to wet.</p>

<p>It would be a good rule to have as few
men as possible out of bed in the night-time,
unless where active service renders it
necessary; for, if unoccupied, they lie about
the decks, fall asleep, and catch cold. In
such situations, might not all the topmen
but one remain on the forecastle, where they
might take exercise, which they could not
do aloft? I am indebted for this remark to
the Rev. Mr. Ramsay, who joins to a great
knowledge of the sea service a warm and
disinterested zeal for its prosperity, and has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
been so good in several other instances as to
communicate to me the results of his experience
and observation.</p>

<p>The good effects resulting from the indulgent
treatment of men are, that it encourages
them to enter into the service, and to
do their duty with cheerfulness and resolution.
There is something more daunting
to the mind of man to see his companions
suffering under oppression and languishing
in disease, or perishing miserably from sores
or sickness, than in the terrors of fire and
sword, which, as we have seen, make the
least part of the calamities of war. The
good treatment of seamen, in so far as it
regards their health, is by no means incompatible
with strict discipline. Indeed strictness
and even severity is necessary with seamen;
for it is observed with regard to men
who are used to arbitrary government, that
they cannot bear indulgence and relaxation.
But the steady enforcement of discipline and
regularity is so far from being akin to cruelty,
that it tends to prevent both sickness
and the commission of crimes, consequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
rendering the infliction of punishment less
frequent and necessary. The chief excellence
in the character of an officer seems to
consist in uniting strict discipline with indulgence
and humanity.</p>

<h3 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>The subject of the preceding remarks
has been the prevention of diseases and it
has appeared that the means of this are not
so much in the province of the medical profession
as of those who are entrusted with
the direction of the navy in a civil or military
capacity; and that with regard to cure
and recovery also, a great deal depends upon
them, by their having it in their power to
make a suitable provision of proper diet and
cordials. The great importance of the subject
will plead my excuse for again calling to
mind, that such attentions are not only dictated
by humanity, but would be the greatest
wisdom in an œconomical and national light,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
considering how expensive it is to <i>replace</i>
men and to support invalids, not to mention
that it is upon the health and lives of men
that every public exertion essentially depends,
and upon which may depend not only
the character of officers, but the national
character in the day of battle.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, that though there is
still room for improvement, the navy is now
on a better footing with regard to the health
and comfort of seamen than it appears to
have been in former times. The victuals
were in general in the late war of excellent
quality; the civil branch has shewn in many
instances a readiness to adopt the means and
to furnish the articles that were recommended
for the health of the men<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>; and most
of the commanders whom I have the honour
to know are humane, attentive, and
intelligent.</p>

<p>To conclude; there is no situation of life
in which there is room for more virtues,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
more conduct and address, than that of a
sea officer. The men are thrown upon his
humanity and attention in more views than
one: they are subject to a more arbitrary
exertion of power than the constitution of
the date authorities in civil life, Englishmen
giving up into his hands, from considerations
of public expediency, that which they
hold most dear, and of which they are most
jealous, their <small>LIBERTY</small>. It is the character
of seamen to be thoughtless and neglectful
of their own interest and welfare, requiring
to be tended like children; but from their
bravery, utility, and other good qualities,
they seem entitled to a degree of <i>parental</i>
tenderness and attention from the state they
protect and the officers they obey.

<blockquote>

<p>Proposing Means for preventing the Sickness
and Mortality prevailing among His Majesty’s
Seamen in the West Indies.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have for the two last years attended a
squadron, consisting seldom of less than
twenty ships of the line, in quality of physician
to the fleet at Barbadoes and the Leeward
Islands. I received, by the order of
the Commander in Chief, a monthly return
from the surgeon of each ship, setting forth
the diseases, deaths, and other circumstances
of the respective ships companies.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
I also superintended the hospital of the place
where the fleet happened to lie when in port.
These advantages have afforded me an intimate
knowledge of the nature and causes of
the sickness and mortality among the seamen,
both on board of their ships and in
hospitals.</p>

<p>It appears by my returns, that there died
in the course of the twelve months preceding
July last, on board of ships, seven hundred
and fifteen seamen and marines, of
whom only fifty-nine died in battle and of
wounds. There died in the same time in
hospitals eight hundred and sixty-two: so
that out of twelve thousand one hundred and
nine men, which is the sum total of the complement
of twenty ships of the line, there
have perished in one year one thousand five
hundred and seventy-seven, that is nearly
every seventh man.</p>

<p>There were also sent to England in the
same year, three hundred and fifty men,
disabled by lameness and chronic complaints,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
the greater part of whom will be for ever
lost to the service.</p>

<p>The degree of sickness is very different at
different times; but it appears by the returns,
that, at a medium, there has been
one man in fifteen on the sick list.</p>

<p>Having employed all the attention of
which I was capable to find out the causes
of this sickness and mortality, in order, if
possible, to point out the means of prevention,
I flatter myself with being able to
assign the most general causes, and to propose
some effectual remedies.</p>

<p>When it is considered that sickness is almost
entirely confined to ships of two and
three decks, and that some of these are as
healthy as frigates and merchant ships,
though in the same circumstances of service
with others that are extremely sickly, we
are led from hence to infer, that sickness is
not in its own nature unavoidable, and we
are encouraged to hope, that the attainment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
of general health is within the compass of
human management.</p>

<p>I humbly and earnestly solicit attention
to some of the most material observations
and conclusions which have occurred in the
course of a service, which, though short,
has been extensive; and whatever is here
proposed has this recommendation, that it is
easily practicable, and is no addition to the
public charges.</p>

<p>First, I hardly ever knew a ship’s company
become sickly which was well regulated
in point of cleanliness and dryness. It
is the custom in some ships to divide the
crew into squads or divisions under the inspection
of respective officers, who make a
weekly review of their persons and clothing,
and are answerable for the cleanliness and
regularity of their several allotments. This
ought to be an indispensable duty in ships of
two or three decks; and when it has been
practised, and at the same time ventilation,
cleanliness, and dryness below and between
decks, have been attended to, I have never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
known seamen more unhealthy than other
men. The neglect of such attentions is a
never-failing cause of sickness.</p>

<p>I would, therefore, with all becoming deference,
suggest, that such a regulation, instead
of being left to the discretion of officers,
should be made a part of the public
instructions. From some commanders, who
already practise these rules, the advantage
of them comes to be known; and would
not a public sanction not only render them
general and permanent, but facilitate the
duty of the officer, by making such a regulation
appear a matter of legal necessity,
instead of his own arbitrary act?</p>

<p>Secondly, Scurvy is one of the principal
diseases with which seamen are afflicted, and
this may be infallibly prevented, or cured,
by vegetables and fruit, particularly oranges,
lemons, or limes. These might be supplied
by employing one or more small vessels to
collect them at different islands, and such an
expedient would prevent much sickness, and
save many lives. I am well convinced that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
more men would be saved by such a purveyance
of fruit and vegetables, than could be
raised by double the expence and trouble employed
on the imprest service; so that policy,
as well as humanity, concur in recommending
it. Every fifty oranges or lemons might
be considered as a hand to the fleet, inasmuch
as the health, and perhaps the life, of a man
would thereby be saved.</p>

<p>Thirdly, The use of wine, in place of
rum, has been found extremely conducive
to health. In the course of my observation
I have met with the most unquestionable
proofs of the benefit that would arise from
this substitution. It is a farther reason for
such a change, that good rum is seldom or
never supplied in the West Indies.</p>

<p>Fourthly, The necessaries provided for the
sick by the present establishment are not at
all adequate, especially on a distant station,
where the supply is not regular, and the
quantity at best is such as can contribute but
little to their comfort and recovery. An
ample provision might be made for the sick,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
without any additional expence, in the following
manner:</p>

<p>It is a rule in the service, that though
men are sick, their ordinary allowance of
salt meat and other victuals is nevertheless
served out, and is either used by the other
seamen, who stand in no need of it, or is
wasted. Now, if the pursers were instructed
to provide themselves with certain species
of necessaries, such as Madeira wine,
sugar, rice, and dried fruits, to serve to the
sick, in place of rum, and the common provisions
of the ship, such a regulation would
be productive of the very best effects, in recovering
the health, and preserving the lives
of those men who have the misfortune to be
taken ill in a situation necessarily destitute
of most of the comforts that can alleviate
their sufferings. I cannot help here applauding
a late regulation, by which melasses are
substituted for part of the oatmeal; for the
quantity of the latter heretofore legally allowed
was so much greater than what was
necessary, that one half of it has commonly
been wasted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span></p>

<p>It is to be observed, in general, with regard
to the West Indies, that ships on service
are to be considered, in a great measure,
in the light of ships constantly at sea; for,
excepting the island of Barbadoes, there is
no other port in which fresh meat and vegetables
can be procured in any quantity, and
therefore sour krout, melasses, and such
other articles of antiscorbutic diet as can be
supplied on board, are absolutely necessary.
Fleets could hardly exist here, were it not
that a warm climate is naturally more unfavourable
to the scurvy than a cold one.</p>

<p>Fifthly, Though the health of a ship’s
company depends chiefly on diet, and that
discipline and order which is the business of
officers, yet much depends also on the medical
art, particularly in the West Indies;
and as surgeons frequently cannot do justice
to the men without wronging themselves,
in a country where the price of every thing
is exorbitant, and medicines often unsound,
Government would find its account in supplying
gratuitously some of the most costly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
articles, particularly Peruvian bark in a fresh
state, from time to time, from England.</p>

<p>Sixthly, It is now the general custom to
send every sick person on shore to an hospital,
where there is frequently worse air and
worse accommodation than on board, from
overcrowding the apartments. Contagious
diseases, though not so common as in Europe,
are here often mixed with those that
are not so, whereby numbers are infected and
carried off; and, besides this, the land air is
infinitely more unwholesome in the West
Indies than the air at sea or in a road. The
scurvy is perhaps not at all contagious, nor
is it very difficult of cure; but a number of
cases of it terminate fatally from the flux or
fever, caught either by contagion in hospitals,
by the noxious influence of land vapours,
or by intemperance. I beg leave, therefore,
humbly to suggest, that as few sick
as possible of any disease, but what is contagious,
be sent to hospitals, and that some
method be established for the supply of vegetables
and other refreshments to the sick
on board of their ships.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span></p>

<p>Seventhly, Crowding, filth, and the mixture
of diseases, are the great causes of mortality
in hospitals. There should be a space
of five hundred cubic feet allowed for each
man; and in general the sick had better remain
on board than be crowded beyond that
degree; or relief should be provided to the
hospital by an hospital ship, which, for reasons
already given, is preferable to any accommodation
on shore; and such an institution
would be more particularly proper for
the reception of convalescent men.</p>

<p>I would beg leave, therefore, earnestly
to recommend that cleanliness, the separation
of diseases, and a competent space, be
regularly enjoined and strictly enforced in
hospitals; and in order to make this more
practicable in the great scale of service now
going on, I would farther propose that hospital
ships be established for the reception of
the sick or recovering. I know from extensive
experience and close observation, that
these circumstances are more essential than
even medicine and diet.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span></p>

<p>These are a few remarks extracted from a
series of observations, and derived from
great opportunities of experience. Many
other remarks would suggest themselves; but
I purposely confine myself to what is highly
important, and easily practicable, with little
or no addition to the public expence.
Some of the improvements recommended
are indeed an immediate, and all of them
will be an eventual, saving to the public.</p>

<p>The alterations that have been proposed
are,</p>

<p>1st, The establishment of a certain method
and discipline, in order to secure regularity
and cleanliness among the men, and
to render the ships clean and dry.</p>

<p>2dly, The supply of fruit and other vegetables
for the cure of the scurvy.</p>

<p>3dly, The substitution of wine<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> for rum.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span></p>

<p>4thly, The provision of an adequate quantity
of necessaries for the sick.</p>

<p>5thly, The gratuitous supply of certain
medicines.</p>

<p>6thly, The curing of certain diseases on
board instead of sending them to hospitals;
and,</p>

<p>Lastly, The preventing of filth, crowding,
and the mixture of diseases in hospitals,
by proper regulations, and by establishing
hospital ships.</p>

<p>I beg leave again to call to mind, that
1518 deaths from disease, besides 350 invalids,
in 12,109 men, in the course of one
year, is an alarming waste of British seamen,
being a number that would man three of
His Majesty’s ships of the line; and what I
advance is from a real conviction that a due
attention to the above-mentioned propositions
would save more than two thirds of
the seamen that would otherwise die in that
climate. It was to set this in a proper light
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
that I requested leave to quit my duty during
the absence of the greater part of the squadron
in the hurricane months; and should
any thing I propose meet with public approbation,
and be carried into effect, I should
esteem it a recompence far above any other
gratification I can derive from the service.</p>

<h4 id="SUPPLEMENT_TO_THE_MEMORIAL"><span class="smcap">Supplement</span> to the <span class="smcap">Memorial</span> delivered

<p>Since my return to my duty on this
station, additional experience has afforded
me farther practical confirmation of the
utility of the former proposals.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span></p>

<p>The great squadron employed on this station
has, by the attention of the Commissioners
of Victualling, and also of the Commander
in Chief, been supplied with most of the
articles recommended, in such quantities as
to prove their efficacy; and indeed the small
degree of mortality in comparison of former
times, is a sufficient demonstration of this.</p>

<p>I beg leave to give an instance in the Formidable
of the great and salutary effects of
the proposed improvements. This ship left
England, furnished not only with sour krout
and melasses, in common with most others
in the squadron, but what was peculiar to
herself was, an entire supply of good wine
in place of spirits; and an experiment has
been made in this instance, under my own
eye, to ascertain what degree of health it
was possible to attain in a great ship in this
climate. With the above advantages, together
with good discipline and medical care,
no man<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> died of disease from December,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
1781, to May, 1782, and only thirteen
were sent to hospitals, whose complaints
were small pox and ulcers. In the months
of May and June last, when at Jamaica,
there died of disease in this ship, three men,
and seventeen were sent to the hospital,
most of whom had contracted their sickness
on board of French prizes.</p>

<p>In the rest of the fleet the health was in
proportion to the wine and other refreshments,
and the cleanliness, good order, and
discipline observed.</p>

<p>In the squadron I attended the last five
months, which seldom consisted, during the
last three months of that time, of less than
forty ships of the line, there have died of
disease about 350 men, and about 1000 have
been sent to hospitals; a degree of sickness
and mortality which, though not greater
than what frequently prevails in Europe, I
am persuaded would have been still less,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
had the improvements proposed been complied
with in a manner more extensive and
complete, and had the general rules of discipline
and cleanliness been kept up with
due and equal strictness throughout the fleet.</p>

<p>This last article, which, being the most
important, I have placed first in the preceding
memorial, it is only in the power of
supreme authority to enforce; and my additional
experience and observation have so far
confirmed me in the opinion of the utility
of this, as well as the other articles, that I
hope to be again pardoned for repeating my
humble and earnest solicitations that these
regulations may be farther extended and enforced.</p>

<p>It was mentioned in the Introduction to
this work, that though my opportunities of
experience were extensive, several obstacles
had prevented me from making observations
so accurately as could have been wished.
These were chiefly the bad accommodation
of the sick at some of the hospitals, and
the shortness of our stay at any one place,
which seldom exceeded six weeks or two
months, and prevented me from completing
such observations as I have happened to be
engaged in. But having practised among
great numbers, observations necessarily arose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
from the comparison of so many cases; and
amidst the variety of situations connected
with the emergencies and hardships of war,
nature is seen in certain portions and under
certain trials which are not met with in
common life. I shall therefore describe the
diseases such as they occurred, and shall add
such remarks on practice as I could ascertain.</p>

<p>The following observations shall be confined
chiefly to what I have called the sea
epidemics, viz. Fevers, Fluxes, and the
Scurvy.

<h2 id="PART_III_CHAP_I">CHAP. I.</h2>

<h3 id="OF_FEVERS">Of <span class="smcap">Fevers</span>.</h3>

<p>Though it is impossible to refer every
particular case of fever to a distinct class, on
account of the mixed and anomalous symptoms
that arise, yet there are certain distinguishing
features which afford sufficient
ground for dividing them into different
kinds, and such a division will at least serve
to facilitate description, and to afford room
for laying down the outlines of practice.</p>

<p>The fevers which occurred most frequently
on board of ships, and at naval hospitals
belonging to the fleet in which I was employed,
were the infectious ship fever,
(which is the same with the jail and hospital
fever) the bilious remitting fever, and
the malignant yellow fever.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span></p>

<h4 id="OF_THE_INFECTIOUS_SHIP_FEVER">1. Of the infectious <span class="smcap">Ship Fever</span>.</h4>

<p>This does not occur so frequently in hot
as in cold climates, both because it is the
disease of ships newly fitted out, which they
seldom are in the West Indies, and because
there is something in the warmth of a climate
which prevents the production of contagion,
as has been formerly remarked. But
as great fleets arrived from time to time in
the West Indies from Europe, with numbers
of men labouring under this fever,
there were sufficient opportunities of making
observations upon it.</p>

<p>It has been so well described by Sir John
Pringle, Dr. Lind, and other writers, that
it is unnecessary to enter into a minute detail
of all its different appearances in its
several stages; and I shall content myself
with recounting some of the most distinguishing
symptoms, and with marking the
peculiarities that arose from the influence of
the climate.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span></p>

<p>This fever is extremely various in its
symptoms and in its degree of malignity
and fatality. We are told in some of the
histories of the jail distemper, that, upon
its first attack, few escaped that were seized
with it; but that afterwards it grew more
mild; and it has been already observed, that
the contagious poison of fever differs from
that of small pox and other specific infections,
by varying in its degrees of virulence.</p>

<p>There are, however, certain characteristic
symptoms pretty constant in this fever in all
its forms.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of these is a
greater degree of muscular debility than what
takes place in other fevers, and it deserves to
be mentioned first, as being one of the most
constant. It is also a tolerably true index of
the degree of malignity, the danger being
in proportion to this symptom. In the more
advanced stages of the fever, a tremor of the
hands, and of the tongue when put out, is
a constant symptom, and seems to be connected
with this weak state of the muscular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
fibres. I have seen, however, extreme debility
without tremor in cases too of the
greatest danger, and it was observable in
these that there was little or no delirium.</p>

<p>Another striking character of this fever is
the delirium of a particular kind which usually
attends it. Sensation and reason are here
in a state uncommonly depraved; and it is
in this sort of fever oftener than any other
that we find a total deprivation of them in
the symptom called <i>coma</i>. The delirium is
seldom of a wild, ungovernable kind, such
as occurs in inflammatory continued fevers,
in the violent paroxysms of intermitting and
remitting fevers, or in inflammations of
the brain. It is, however, connected with
great suffering; and this consists in anguish
rather than pain, shewing itself by outward
tremor, agitation, and what is called the
<i>floccorum collectio</i>; also by sighing, mumbling,
and moaning, symptoms always indicating
danger.</p>

<p>Delirium is a symptom, to the nature and
appearances of which I have been particularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
attentive, in consequence of a painful
and diligent attendance upon some cases in
which I was particularly interested from
friendship and affection, and in which this
was a remarkable symptom. It seems chiefly
to consist in a false reference of our sensations,
whether external or internal; and
this is in no sort of fever more evident
than in this. When any painful impression, for instance,
is made by an external
body, the patient, if in a state of delirium,
does not refer it justly to the part affected;
but the general agitation and incoherence of
sentiments will be aggravated for the time.
I have known a degree of heat applied to
the extremities sufficient to blister them,
yet the part did not shrink, though the raving
and general uneasiness were increased.
In like manner, with regard to internal sensations,
when an irritation is excited to expel
the urine or <i>feces</i>, the mind does not recognize
it as such, but from a sense of uneasiness,
probably mistaken for something else,
an effort is made to relieve nature, which
is done without a proper consciousness, and
certain symptoms are produced which are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
well-known marks of danger in this fever.
In watching those who have been under the
influence of delirium, I have observed it increase
when any particular want of nature
urged, and this would continue for some
time, the patient being incapable of procuring
himself immediate relief on account of
the false reference of sensation that has been
mentioned; but he would become calm after
voiding the urine or <i>feces</i>, or after receiving
something to drink, according to the
particular want that was present at the time.
So great is the disorder in the common
course of sensation in this fever, that a person
ill of it has been even unconscious of inflammations
of vital parts, which, in the natural
state of the nerves, would have excited
the most acute pain, and would have been
distinctly referred to the part affected, but
were not discovered nor suspected till inspection
after death<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>. I remember one case in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
which there were found large erosions, and
even holes in the intestines, without any
preceding complaint that could have led to
suspect such an appearance. It would appear
that the motions excited in the brain
and nerves in such cases, instead of producing
the sensations naturally belonging to
them, serve to excite disagreeable emotions
of a different kind, in which delirium consists.
It seems to be from the same depraved
state of sensation, that when a phthisical
person is seized with this sort of fever, his
cough is for the time suspended. I have
seen the same circumstance occur in a maniacal
case. From a like cause it sometimes
happens in dangerous cases of fever, that
in the height of delirium the <i>epiglottis</i> loses
its natural irritability, so that liquids in the
act of swallowing are apt to get into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
windpipe, so as to excite coughing and
threaten suffocation, as I have observed in
some cases that came under my care.</p>

<p>All these different forms of delirium are
signs of a body extremely disordered in its
functions, and forbode great danger.</p>

<p>The next symptom I shall mention as
most characteristic of this sort of fever is,
the spots known by the name of <i>petechi&aelig;</i>
and <i>vibices</i>, which, though far from being
constant, are, perhaps, more peculiar to it
than any other symptom. They occur only
in the latter stages of the disease, and in
cases of considerable danger. The common
opinion concerning their cause is, that the
blood is in such a dissolved state, that the
red part of it is effused into the cellular
membrane. The appearance in such bodies
as I have inspected, seems to favour this
opinion; for there was hardly any coagulation
of the blood in the great vessels, and
instead of those firm substances, called <i>polypi</i>,
in the heart, there were only soft grumous
bodies, which were so tender in their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
consistence, that, upon being handled, they,
as it were, dissolved. Since the improved
method of treating these fevers has been
generally adopted, this symptom seldom
occurs; for in most cases it may be called
an artificial symptom, chiefly arising from
close apartments and the heat of bed clothes.</p>

<p>It may be considered as a peculiarity of
this fever, that it is more indefinite in its
crisis than most others. In continued fevers
of the inflammatory kind, there are frequent
attempts at remission, there are certain periodical
exacerbations, and there is generally
a distinct crisis marked by a freedom of the
secretions and turbid urine: but in the fever
of which we are treating, though the patient
is generally somewhat worse towards
the evening and during the night, its course
is more equable, and the transition from
sickness to health is insensible and gradual,
being seldom marked with any perceptible
crisis.</p>

<p>The symptom next to be taken notice of,
though a minute one, is very constant and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
characteristic in this sort of fever. It is a
peculiar heat in the skin, communicated to
the hand of another person. It is usual to
grasp the wrist of the patient after feeling
his pulse, in order to examine the state of
the skin in point of heat and moisture; and
in doing this a glow of heat is impressed on
the palm of the hand, which lasts for some
hours, if one should neglect so long to wash
the hands. I have never met with this
symptom in any of the sporadic fevers of
England, though I am informed it sometimes
occurs in these.</p>

<p>The fever we are treating of differs also
from the sporadic nervous fever of England,
and from most others of the continued
kind, in being attended with a more copious
secretion of bile, which, when thrown up,
is generally green, or, as it is otherwise
called, of a porraceous colour. This symptom
takes place in all climates; but is more
remarkable in a hot climate, as might be
expected.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span></p>

<p>These are the chief characteristic symptoms
of this fever. I shall next point out
such modifications of it as occurred in the
West Indies from the influence of climate.</p>

<p>In the first place, when this fever prevailed
on board of any ship that arrived from a
northern climate, it was soon after succeeded
by, or, as it were, converted into, a dysentery;
for those ships that arrived either
from England or North America with the
greatest stock of feverish infection, were the
most subject to fluxes, after being two or
three months in the West Indies. This
was formerly made use of as an argument,
to prove that the dysentery proceeds from
the same cause with fever, taking a different
determination, from circumstances of
climate and constitution.</p>

<p>Secondly, It sometimes happens that men,
under the influence of this infection, are
more apt than others to be affected with
symptoms peculiar to the climate upon their
first arrival. A very striking instance of this
has been mentioned in the case of men that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
were pressed into the Formidable at New
York, some of whom had the common ship
fever on the passage; others, upon our arrival
at Barbadoes, were seized with the yellow
fever, and were the only men in the
fleet who had it at that time. There was
another instance in the recruits brought
from England by the Anson, who were
seized with a fever on board of the Royal
Oak; and in this fever the skin and eyes
were yellow, though without any symptoms
of malignancy<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, It happened in some ships<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
that the infection was kept up for several
months after arriving in the climate, from a
neglect of cleanliness, or the want of an opportunity
of removing those who were infected
to an hospital. It did not in these
take a dysenteric turn, as in most of the
other ships, but differed from the ship fever
of colder climates, as above described, in
some particulars, which I shall here enumerate.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
All the symptoms were milder:
it was more protracted, and less dangerous.
In the beginning there was but little difference,
only the symptoms were less violent;
but in the succeeding period of the disease
the pulse deviated very little from the natural
standard, and the skin felt cold and clammy.
The tongue was white; and this did not
seem so much owing to any fur covering it,
as to its being itself of a pale, lifeless colour,
as well as the face, and it appeared larger in
size than natural. The teeth were clogged
with a white fur. Those affected with this
fever were subject to faintings, and had a
constant uncomfortable languor and listlessness.
Most of them had a deep-seated pain
in the occiput, and an oppression at the
stomach, but without any inclination to
vomit. The unfavourable symptoms were
<i>coma</i>, <i>delirium</i> and a yellowness of the skin.
I never remember to have seen <i>petechi&aelig;</i> in
any of them. The favourable symptoms
were a warm moisture, or a miliary eruption
on the skin, and a gentle <i>diarrhœa</i>,
which, however, if neglected, was in danger
of degenerating into an incurable flux.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
A great number were seized with this fever
in the Alcide, in July, 1783, and what is
remarkable, most of them had the tape
worm, as I was informed by Mr. Telford,
the surgeon of that ship, who frequently
obliged me with valuable remarks; and he
observed also, that it was evidently infectious,
and that the skin communicated the
same disagreeable feeling to the hand as was
mentioned above.</p>

<p>Though the inflammatory fever does not
often occur in hot climates, yet, as it is of
great consequence to distinguish it in all
cases from the infectious fever of which we
are treating, it may not be improper, nor
uninstructive, here to point out the most
remarkable differences. There is more resemblance
in their symptoms, especially towards
the beginning, than might at first be
supposed; and as it is very material to avoid
error with regard to the practice, which, in
these two sorts of fevers, ought to be very
different, and even opposite, I have taken
particular pains to discriminate them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span></p>

<p>The continued inflammatory fever is very
uncommon in the West Indies; but in the
form in which I have met with it in North
America and England, there are cases in
which the blood is sizy during the whole
course of the disease, even without local
affection, though, in general, there is more
or less rheumatism, or pulmonic inflammation.
The symptoms which chiefly distinguish
such cases from the fever before described
are, a greater degree of muscular
strength, a more violent delirium, pale
urine, a more parched tongue and skin,
greater heat and thirst, and a pulse more
frequent and strong, with a particular sharpness.
There is another symptom sometimes
occurring, which I consider as strongly characteristic
of a fever of an inflammatory nature.
This is a watery diarrhœa, without
<i>f&aelig;ces</i> and without gripes, the stools consisting
chiefly of the drink as it was taken in.
There seems here to be a suspension of the
power of absorption as well as secretion in
the bowels, in consequence of a general
spasm on the extreme vessels; for there
is hardly even bile or mucus in the stools.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
There is also a particular appearance of the
mouth connected with this type of fever,
which is better learned by the eye than by
description. It consists chiefly in a want
of moisture on the lips, and a dryness and
shining appearance of the teeth. With
these symptoms, it will be found that the
patient will bear the lancet in very advanced
stages of the disease. These fevers seldom
occur but in a sporadic way, unless when
there is some peculiarity of season, as at
New York in autumn, 1782. They are
also more frequent among the better than
the lower sort of people.</p>

<p>By comparing these symptoms with those
of the infectious fever above described, there
will appear an obvious difference in their nature,
and evident reasons for varying their
treatment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment</span> of the <span class="smcap">Ship Fever</span>.</h4>

<p>When the body is thrown into disorder
by an attack of fever, the first step to be
taken is to clear the stomach and bowels of
their crude and acrid contents, consisting
either of the food imperfectly digested, or
the depraved natural secretions. So great
is the disturbance produced by such offending
matter, that, when nature is freed from
this embarrassment, the functions of the
body are frequently by this alone restored to
their proper exercise, and a remission produced.
It seems probable also, that this
evacuation proves salutary not only by removing
the morbid stimulus, but by preventing
the absorption of corrupted or ill-concocted
juices into the mass of blood,
which would tend still farther to derange
the functions of life. But perhaps the circumstance
that first suggested the utility of
evacuating the stomach, as the first step in
the cure of fevers, was the nausea so common
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
in the beginning of them, which may
be considered as a natural indication of this
practice. It farther appears rational, that,
as acute diseases generally come on suddenly,
and find the body in a state of repletion
from the recent <i>ingesta</i>, the most obvious
means of relief should be to free the bowels,
and particularly the stomach, from what is
foreign and oppressive to it. It seems also
probable, that the <i>nausea</i> and the act of vomiting
have a salutary effect independent of
evacuation; for I have seen relief produced
from these when nothing was evacuated.
Such, indeed, is the great and universal influence
and sympathy of the stomach, that
the operation of vomiting affects every fibre
of the body, and has been known to resolve
tumours in the most distant parts. An early
administration of an emetic is therefore the
first step to be taken in the treatment of
this as well as most other fevers.</p>

<p>If it is given in small divided doses, it will
most probably evacuate the bowels downwards;
and the most convenient form for
this purpose is a solution of emetic tartar. If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
it should not have this effect, some brisk
purgative medicine should be given soon after
the operation of it.</p>

<p>I mention these evacuations before blood
letting; for though this ought to be first in
those cases in which it is proper, it is here
seldom necessary, and we may pronounce it
to be a remedy very ill adapted to this sort
of fever, particularly in a hot climate. It
sometimes happens, however, that there is
violent head-ach, pain of the back and limbs,
with a throbbing pulse; and these symptoms
may in the very beginning not only
justify, but require the losing some blood
before the administration of the emetic or
purgative.</p>

<p>The next means of relief I shall mention,
and also the most probable means of cutting
short the disease, is to excite universal
sweat. This being an imitation of nature,
is founded on reason as well as experience;
for it is by sweating that the fit of an intermittent
is relieved and terminated; and continued
fevers in general, if not always, begin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
with a fit of the same kind. A dry skin,
accompanied with heat, is one of the most
constant as well as troublesome and uneasy
symptoms in all fevers; and it would appear
from the peculiar heat of the skin in this
sort of fever, that there is either a more
than common acrimony of the matter of
perspiration, or something peculiar in the
mode of circulation on the surface of the
body. Sweating does not seem to operate
entirely by the evacuation of acrimony, for
no relief is procured by it if it is partial;
and it is evident from a number of facts
that the state of the brain and <i>viscera</i> depends
on that of the external surface of the
body; for a free state of the pores of the
skin, provided it is general, tends more than
any other circumstance to relieve internal
pain, and also to take off delirium. The
good effect of sweating seems, therefore,
chiefly to depend on a general relaxed state
of the small vessels on the surface of the
body; and it ought to be effected, if possible,
by gentle, soothing means, and not by
such regimen and medicines as heat the body
and accelerate the circulation. This intention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
is best answered in the beginning by moderate
doses of antimonial medicines, and
either James’s powder or tartar emetic may
be employed. The first is a more certain
sudorific, being less apt than the other to
run off by the bowels; and its effect will
be still more certain, if accompanied with a
mild opiate, rendered diaphoretic by <i>Spiritus
Mindereri</i>, which will both prevent the antimonial
from acting roughly, and will determine
its operation to the skin. A sweat
kept up by these means, together with plentiful
warm dilution, from twelve to twenty-four
hours, is the most probable means
of bringing about a complete remission of
the fever; and in this case a fresh accession
is to be prevented by the immediate administration
of the bark.</p>

<p>These are the means proper for stopping
the fever in the beginning, or tending to
render its future progress more safe; and
though, with this view, free evacuations
have been recommended, yet, if the fever
should go on, great caution is necessary in
this respect in the future treatment, debility
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
being the symptom chiefly to be guarded
against. Purgatives may, indeed, be occasionally
necessary, in consequence of accumulations
of bile taking place; but, in general,
the evacuations by stool should not
be more frequent than in health; and some
of the cases which were most unmanageable
and fatal, were those in which there was a
spontaneous <i>diarrhœa</i>. With regard to blood
letting, it is always hurtful after the first
two days, unless some inflammatory affection
of a vital part should arise.</p>

<p>The natural evacuation, which may with
most safety and advantage be solicited and
encouraged in this disease, is, that by perspiration;
and it is observable, that in those
cases for which nature does most, there is a
universal warm sweat, which has generally
a very offensive smell, and seems to be a salutary
effort of the constitution to cure the
disease. Where this takes place, little medical
assistance is necessary, except to keep
it up chiefly by warm dilution; and there
is no circumstance in which the judgement
of a physician is shewn more than in discerning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
those cases in which his chief business
is to look on, where nature, being
equal to the task, ought not to be disturbed
by the active and officious interposition of
art. We should not, however, aim at producing
a profuse sweat, except with a view
to effect a remission immediately after the
first evacuations. In the course of the disease,
it is only necessary to keep up a gentle
moisture or softness of the skin.</p>

<p>The head being particularly affected in
this sort of fever, the patient is extremely
restless and delirious, especially at night;
and there is a medicine which has a most
pleasing effect in procuring both rest and
perspiration. This is a combination of an
opiate with an antimonial medicine, which
was administered in the evening with great
success; and the sudorific effect is rendered
more certain by the addition of some saline
neutral, especially <i>Spiritus Mindereri</i><a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
tried pure opiates in the early stage of this,
fever, but found them not to answer;
though in the low<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> fevers of England, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
in the advanced stages and convalescent state
of this fever, they are extremely safe and
useful. Pure laudanum is also given by Dr.
Lind, at Haslar, with great success in the
height of the disease; but in the West Indies
there is a greater tendency to acrid excretions,
and the effect of pure opium in
causing a retention of these, seems to be
the cause of its disagreeing in that climate
in the first stage of this fever.</p>

<p>It may here be observed, that the addition
of a little neutral salt alone will sometimes
so qualify the operation of opium, as
to prevent its bad effects, such as the increase
of febrile heat and delirium, and the
stupor and head-ach which, when given
alone, it frequently induces the following
day. I have generally employed nitre with
this intention; but this does not seem so
well adapted to this disease as some other
neutral salts, as it tends too much to lower
the powers of life.</p>

<p>But with a view to perspiration, the <i>Spiritus
Mindereri</i> is the most effectual neutral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
medicine when conjoined with an opiate,
and there is not, perhaps, a more safe and
pleasing diaphoretic known than a combination
of it with syrup of poppies<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>. There
is some neutral salt in Dover’s powder, and
this has more effect than could be expected
from so small a quantity of an inert medicine;
for I know from trials of my own,
as well as those of others, that ipecacuanha
and opium given together, in the proportions
prescribed in that powder, will not
have the same effect as when joined with the
neutral salt. This is an instance of those
useful combinations of medicines which can
be discovered only by experience, but which
every physician ought gladly to adopt in
practice upon good testimony and fair trial,
though he may not be able to account for
their effects, nor to explain their mode of
operation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span></p>

<p>There is nothing more important than
plentiful warm dilution; and the infusion of
sauge, or any such light aromatic, is rather
more proper than farinaceous decoctions, or
any compositions in which there is wine or
spirits. Success in this, as well as other
diseases, depends on attention to nursing as
much as upon medicine; for what would it
avail here to administer medicines for promoting
perspiration, unless they were assisted
with fluids to allay thirst, to dilute the
acrimony in the first passages and in the
vessels, and to furnish the materials of free
perspiration?</p>

<p>But however desirable it may be to procure
sweat, this is not to be attempted by close
rooms and bed clothes, nor by hot medicines,
such as volatile salts, serpentary, spirituous
tinctures, or aromatics. These, according
to the testimony of Sydenham, tend
to increase the heat and delirium, and to
produce <i>petechi&aelig;</i>, miliary eruptions, or local
inflammations. In the intervals of the anodyne
diaphoretic above described, <i>Spiritus
Mindereri</i> and small doses of camphor, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
proper dilution, may be safely employed to
procure a soft skin.</p>

<p>The only other means I shall mention
with this view is, the application of warm
moisture to the surface of the body, which
may be done by soaking the feet and hands
in warm water, or by fomenting the feet
and legs with stupes<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>. These operations
have the effect of bringing on a general relaxation
on the skin, thereby taking off febrile
agitation and delirium, and inducing
sleep. I sometimes, with seeming benefit,
ordered cataplasms to be applied to the feet,
merely of the emollient kind, without mustard
or any other acrid substance, being intended
to relax, and not to stimulate.</p>

<p>In the use of pediluvia and fomentations,
there is a difference worth attending to between
the practice in this fever, and that in
the inflammatory fever before described, for
they are as hurtful in the latter as they are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
beneficial in the former. I have observed,
in general, that they have a bad effect in all
cases where there is sizy blood, particularly
where the breast is affected.</p>

<p>Delirium is one of the most constant and
alarming symptoms in this disease, and the
removing of it depends much upon the attendants
as well as the physician. It has
been said before, that it depended on a false
apprehension of the impressions or natural
sensations. When a person, for example,
labours under delirium, and is affected with
thirst, the minds is either so agitated with
other objects, that this sensation is overlooked,
or, instead of producing a craving
for drink, it excites some other disagreeable
emotion in consequence of the disordered
state of <i>sensorium</i>. This last seems to
be probable from the cessation of delirium,
which will take place upon any natural want
being satisfied; I have seen a temporary
stop put to the patients raving by making
him drink, or upon his discharging his
urine or <i>feces</i>; for he is then unconscious
of thirst and other natural wants, is therefore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
ignorant of the means of satisfying
them; and when he does so, he fancies he is
about something else which is the subject
of his delirious thoughts. This observation
leads to a material practical purpose; for it
follows from it, that unremitting attention
should be given to the patient’s feelings and
all his possible wants, as those natural notices
and instinctive cravings which occur in
health are now wanting, in consequence of
the depraved state of sensation.</p>

<p>Most of the remarks that have hitherto
been made apply to the earlier stages of the
disease. The principal remedies applicable
in the more advanced stages are, blisters,
Peruvian bark, opium, and wine.</p>

<p>I have found what Dr. Lind says concerning
the efficacy of blisters confirmed by my
own experience, especially in those fevers in
which there was great delirium, <i>coma</i>, and
head-ach; but I have not experience enough
to say whether they were as useful in the
beginning of the disease in the West Indies
as he found them to be in England.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span></p>

<p>The men that were brought from the
ships to the hospitals were affected with the
disease in various stages; but as we had in
general a very inaccurate history of the several
cases, the method of treatment upon
their first admission was pretty nearly the
same in all; and it consisted, in the first
place, in washing their face, hands, feet,
and legs, with warm water and vinegar,
from which they derived the greatest comfort,
being commonly very dirty. There
ought to be a <a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>warm bath at every naval hospital
kept in constant readiness; for there
are so few conveniences on board of a ship
for preserving bodily cleanliness among the
sick, that the surface of the body becomes
loaded with filth, so that the operation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
the warm bath could not fail to be highly
comfortable and salutary as the first step to
their cure when brought on shore. We had
generally very indistinct information about
the state of their bowels, as well as other
circumstances, on account of their delirium;
but it was at any rate useful, or at least
safe, to give them a clyster. They were
enjoined plentiful dilution; and if they
were low, some wine and water was allowed.
In the evening, the anodyne diaphoretic
medicine was administered, and a
blister applied to some part of the body. In
consequence of this method, we seldom failed
to find the patients better next morning;
and it was tried in such numbers, that the
efficacy of it was sufficiently ascertained. It
happened in some cases, that these means
were omitted, and a comparison of these
with the others served to ascertain the true
efficacy of the medicines; the stationary
state of the symptoms, when the disease
was thus left to itself, sufficiently proving
the propriety of the treatment above described.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span></p>

<p>It is an important question to what circumstances
of this fever the Peruvian bark
is adapted. An early and indiscriminate use
of it is recommended in some late publications,
upon the authority of which I tried
it without regard to the stages or symptoms,
and without any prejudice either for or
against the practice; but I found that this
powerful remedy was in danger of doing
much harm, unless great attention was paid
to circumstances, in order to ascertain the
proper seasons for giving it. The symptoms
that forbid the use of bark are chiefly
foul bowels, hard pulse, sizy blood, great
delirium, dry tongue, a hot and dry skin,
and inflammatory affections of the viscera.
It was found extremely pernicious in an
early stage of the disease previous to evacuations;
and the object of practice at this time
should be to relieve the habit by means of
these, in order to produce a general relaxation
of the secretions, and to render the skin
cool and soft, thereby paving the way for
the bark.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span></p>

<p>It is not necessary, however, especially in
the advanced stages of the disease in this
climate, to wait for an absolute remission,
in order to administer the bark. In a cold
or temperate climate it will seldom be found
advisable to give it in any period of this
fever; but in a hot climate it is sometimes
admissible where there are symptoms
of general debility, such as a small pulse
and muscular weakness, even though the
frequency of the pulse, delirium, and a dry
skin and tongue, should indicate some degree
of fever. It may be remarked, by the
bye, that a dry tongue is a fallacious symptom,
for it may happen in consequence of
the patient’s breathing through the mouth
instead of the nose, without any fault in the
secretions of the <i>fauces</i>. The symptom
which forbids the use of the bark more absolutely
than any other is an inflammatory
or dysenteric state of the bowels, in which
cases it seems to be invariably pernicious.</p>

<p>Where it happens that we are extremely
anxious to throw in the bark, as we usually
are in the West Indies, where fevers are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
very rapid and dangerous, and yet the
symptoms seem hardly to admit its use, it
was very commonly tried either in conjunction
with some antimonial medicine or neutral
salt, or these were given alternately
with it, in order to soften and qualify its
effects by preventing it from heating or
otherwise aggravating the symptoms. Antimonial
wine or <i>Spiritus Mindereri</i> were conveniently
employed with this intention.</p>

<p>With regard to the quantity of bark to be
given, it may be proper in doubtful cases of
this kind to begin with small doses, in order
to feel how far it agrees or not; but in general
it may be laid down as a rule with regard
to this medicine, that, where it is
really proper, and the medicine to be depended
on, it is to be given in as large doses
and as frequently as the stomach will easily
bear it.</p>

<p>The next remedy mentioned was opium.
It is a medicine more admissible and useful
in this than any other kind of fever. The
same cautions nearly apply in the administration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
of it as have been given with regard
to the Peruvian bark. The caution with
regard to foul bowels is particularly necessary
in a hot climate, where an over secretion
of bile is so apt to take place. When,
the Boreas frigate arrived from England in
March, 1783, there was a very bad fever of
the infectious kind on board, some cases of
which being sent to the hospital at St. Lucia,
were treated unsuccessfully with bark
and opium, which I had been induced to
try upon the authority of the authors above
alluded to. I attributed this want of success
to the neglect of previous evacuation;
for, upon inspecting the bodies, the intestines
were found full of bilious <i>feces</i>. I profited
from this, and was more successful in the
other cases. It were to be wished that physicians
could oftener bring themselves to confess
their errors in practice, and their writings
would be more instructive; for it is of
consequence to know what we are to avoid
as well as what we are to follow.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that the best effects
arise from the conjunction of an antimonial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
with an opiate; but, in this sort of fever,
antimonials, and even most of the neutral
salts, are hurtful after the first stage, and
opiates may after this be given alone or
combined with camphor. With regard to
the precise period of leaving off antimonials,
it must be left to discretion, and the constitution
of the patient is the best guide.
There is so great a difference in patients in
this respect, that all practical precepts should
be qualified by a due discrimination of constitutions.
Absolute and dogmatical rules
are so far from applying in the practice of
physic, that there are some cases of the
same disease that require a treatment even
opposite to what is in general most adviseable.
This may be very aptly illustrated
by the small pox, of which there are cases
that ought to be treated very differently from
the general method laid down by Sydenham,
and in which cordial medicines are highly
proper and necessary. This difference in
diseases themselves seems to be one great
cause of the difference of opinion among
physicians on practical points, each party
finding some countenance in experience for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
their general doctrine, do not make allowance
for the varieties that exist in nature;
so that, in one sense, both may be said to be
in the right. If the patient is not very
much sunk, and if there are bilious symptoms,
or an obstinate dryness in the skin, a
few grains of James’s powder may be given
with advantage even in an advanced period
of the disease. If a hot and dry skin should
at this period be the only troublesome symptom,
it will be more safely and effectually
removed by camphor combined with something
opiate and the <i>Spiritus Mindereri</i>, which
is the only neutral now admissible, than by
antimonials, which, at this time, would be
in danger either of ruffling the patient by
their operation on his stomach and bowels,
or of weakening him too much either in
this way, or by exciting profuse sweats.
Evacuant medicines of every kind being
then improper, clysters are the only laxatives
to be employed in case the state of the
bowels require them.</p>

<p>Having mentioned camphor, it may be
proper here to remark, that it is a medicine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
of which I have found it extremely difficult
to ascertain the virtues and effects; and in
consequence of this ambiguity, I believe
there are few articles of the materia medica
more abused in practice. In all inflammatory
affections, and in the beginning of all
fevers where there is much heat and thirst,
I think I have observed it to aggravate the
symptoms. It seems in no case to be more
proper than at certain periods of this fever,
and especially when there happens to be
spasmodic pains of the stomach, or tremors
and cramps in the extremities.</p>

<p>In this advanced stage of the fever, in
which the most common symptoms are weakness,
restlessness, tremors, and low delirium,
no medicine was found so much to be trusted
to as opium, which here acts as a cordial as
well as an anodyne and antispasmodic. It
may be given, in the camphorated julep, in
the form of tincture, from five to ten drops
every six or eight hours, or some of the officinal
compounds, such as the theriaca or
mithridate, may be employed with advantage.
I have thought also, that, at this period,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
castor conjoined with opium seemed to
improve its virtue. This was first suggested
to me by Mr. Crudie, an ingenious German
surgeon, whom I employed as an assistant at
the hospital at St. Lucia; and since I have
been physician to St. Thomas’s hospital, I
have found the most pleasing effects, in similar
cases, from a composition used there,
the principal ingredients of which are opium
and castor<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>.</p>

<p>In this state of the fever I have also used
with advantage the decoction of Peruvian
bark and serpentary, as recommended by
Sir John Pringle; and when the skin is cold
and the circulation is very languid, as is
sometimes the case, volatile salts and powder
of serpentary may very properly be employed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span></p>

<p>But in the advanced state, and in the
worst forms of this disease, there is perhaps
no medicine superior to wine. This was
given either pure, or diluted with water for
common drink, and sometimes to the quantity
of a quart in twenty-four hours. In
delicate people, such as we meet with in
private practice, the quantity ought to be
less.</p>

<p>There is this caution necessary with regard
to the use of wine, that when the fever
is gone off, and only extreme debility remains,
the free use of it is not safe nor proper;
for, in a weak and exhausted state, a
person is more apt to be <a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>heated and intoxicated
by any fermented liquor, than in
health, or even in the preternatural and disturbed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
state of actual disease, such as occurs
in this fever.</p>

<p>After the disease is removed, a long state
of weakness is apt to succeed, especially in
a warm climate. The most proper remedies,
then, are bitters, such as decoctions of Peruvian
bark, infusions of quassia bark, gentian,
or camomile flowers. These answer
better than the bark in substance, which is
now apt to nauseate and load the stomach,
and the patient is apt to take an aversion to
this and whatever else he took in a state of
sickness. The best strengthening medicines
are such as comfort the stomach and create
appetite; and we may mention Huxham’s
tincture of bark, in small doses, and a moderate
use of wine, as the most proper for
these purposes. Where colliquative sweats
take place, elixir of vitriol is serviceable,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
and with this intention I have joined it,
with evident advantage, to the evening anodyne,
which, without such a corrector, tends
rather to aggravate this symptom. I have
known assafœtida prove a useful stimulus to
the stomach at this time, and it may even
be used while the fever subsists, especially
where the secretions of the fauces are scanty.
This medicine is recommended by Sir John
Pringle in the same circumstances. But I
consider the prudent use of opiates, particularly
at bedtime, as the most effectual cordial
and strengthening medicine in this convalescent
state.</p>

<p>But with regard to the management of
the sick at this time, as much depends on
diet as medicine. Nothing has been said
concerning this in the acute state of fever,
because no nourishment is then necessary.
In that state there is a loathing of all food,
and the powers of digestion and assimilation
seem to be then suspended, so that alimentary
substances become not only an useless
load, but offensive and hurtful by turning
acid or putrid. It is likewise evident from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
fact, as well as reason, that nature, in this
situation, does not require sustenance; for
we frequently see people labouring under
fevers who do well and recover, though
they have been entirely without nourishment
for a length of time in which the like abstinence
in a state of health would have
proved fatal. The friends and attendants
of the sick, from a prejudice not unnatural,
but not considering the difference between
health and that state of derangement which
takes place in fever, are for ever wishing to
supply the patient with nourishment, and
every physician meets with trouble in counteracting
this officiousness. Nevertheless,
when the fever draws out to a considerable
length, and the principal symptom is that
state of weakness which, in low fevers, runs
insensibly into that of convalescence, then
it is necessary to pay the utmost attention
to nourishment, and nothing tends more to
insure and hasten recovery than the assiduous
administration of light and nourishing
food, the same cautions being observed which
have just been mentioned with regard to
cordials. One of the greatest hardships of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
a sea life is the want of those articles of diet
that are suitable to a recovering state, and
many lives are lost from this circumstance,
after the force of the disease has been subdued<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>.</p>

<p>With regard to the peculiar form, before
described<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>, which this fever assumes a few
months after ships have been in a hot climate,
we found camphor, volatile salts, and serpentary,
the best remedies. As there was a
remarkable coldness of the skin, I was induced
in one case to try the hot bath, and
with good effect, from which it seems probable
that a short stay in a bath, of a heat
from 96&deg; to 100&deg;, so as to have its warming
and stimulating, without its relaxing
effects, would answer well in fevers of this
kind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span></p>

<h4 id="OF_THE_BILIOUS_REMITTING_FEVER">2. Of the <span class="smcap">Bilious Remitting Fever</span>.</h4>

<p>This is peculiar to tropical climates,
and arises in the same situations in which
intermitting fevers arise in temperate and
cold climates. It seldom arises at sea, unless
where there has been previous exposure
on shore, of which some examples have
been mentioned in the first part of the work.
It may generally be traced to the air of
woods or marshes; and in our fleet hardly
any men were attacked with it but those
who were employed in the duties of wooding
and watering.</p>

<p>The most distinguishing symptom is a copious
secretion of bile which attends it. Its
course, in general, is shorter than that of
the fever before described; and though the
symptoms are more violent, they are not so
equal and steady, owing to the tendency
there is to remission. The symptoms are
particularly violent at the beginning, in so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
much that some of the men, after being exposed
upon duty to the heat of the sun and
the air of marshes and woods, would become
frantic, being seized almost instantaneously
with <i>delirium</i> resembling madness.
This fever, when it arises merely from the
effluvia of woods and marshes, has a natural
tendency to remit; nay, some fevers at St.
Lucia, proceeding from this cause, were of
the pure intermitting form from the beginning.
But in many of those that arose at
Jamaica little or no remission was to be perceived;
and it was distinguished from the
ship fever by the bilious vomits and stools,
more violent delirium, and head-ach, and
by being attended with less debility. The
greater tendency to the continued form at
this time was probably owing to this circumstance,
that the men who were exposed
to the land air in wooding and watering,
were then exposed also to such causes as
naturally produce continued fevers, such as
infection, the foul air of the French prizes,
intemperance, and hard labour. There was
in some cases a yellowness of the eye, and
even of the whole skin, but without the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
other symptoms that characterise the yellow
fever, properly so called.</p>

<p>In cases that proved fatal, the symptoms,
for some time before death, resembled very
much those of the fever before described at
the same stage. There was either <i>coma</i> or
constant delirium, great seeming anguish,
the mouth and tongue very dry, or with
only a little ropy slime, a black crust on the
teeth, picking of the clothes, and involuntary
stools.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment of the Bilious Remitting
Fever.</span></h4>

<p>The measures proper to be taken in the
beginning of all fevers are pretty nearly
the same. There is little difference in
the first treatment of this from that of the
ship fever, except that blood letting is here
more frequently proper, and that a more
free evacuation of the bowels is necessary
on account of the more copious secretion of
bile.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span></p>

<p>In full and athletic habits the disease very
commonly begins with pains in the limbs,
back, and head, with a strong throbbing
pulse; in which case it is proper first of all
to let blood at the arm. This is also highly
proper and necessary in those cases mentioned
above, in which the patient becomes suddenly
frantic. But though the cases requiring
blood-letting are more frequent in this
sort of fever than that already treated of,
yet great caution and nice discernment are
necessary with regard to it, in all cases, in a
hot climate. As fevers in such a climate
run their course faster, the symptoms succeeding
each other in a more close and hurried
manner, greater expedition, as well as
discernment, are required in timing the different
remedies than what are necessary in a
cold climate. Blood letting unseasonably
and injudiciously employed either endangers
life, or has a very remarkable effect in protracting
recovery, by the irrecoverable weakness
it induces.</p>

<p>With regard to the evacuation by the
bowels, it has already been mentioned in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
another part of the work, when on the subject
of prevention, that, before the fever
comes on, there is a languor and general
feeling of indisposition, and that then an
emetic and a purgative, followed by some
doses of the bark, were the most likely
means of preventing the attack of the disease.
If the fever has properly begun, which
is announced by a <i>rigor</i> taking place, then
no time is to be lost in procuring evacuation;
and, after blood letting, if the symptoms
should require it, the best medicine is tartar
emetic, which, if given in small divided
doses, at short intervals, will most probably
evacuate the whole intestines by vomiting
and purging, and may even prove sudorific.
But it will nevertheless be proper to administer
a purgative medicine soon after; and
what we found to operate with most ease,
expedition, and effect, was, a solution of
purging salts and manna, either in an infusion
of sena, or in common water, or barley
water, with some tincture of sena added
to it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span></p>

<p>The next step towards procuring a remission
is, to open the pores of the skin,
which is best done by small doses of James’s
powder or emetic tartar, assisted by the common
saline draughts, which will be given
with most advantage in the act of effervescence,
or by <i>Spiritus Mindereri,</i> together
with plentiful warm dilution. I once, by
way of comparison, tried the two antimonial
preparations above mentioned in a number
of men ill of this fever, who were sent
to the hospital at one time, giving emetic
tartar to one half, and James’s powder to
the other, and their effects were so similar,
that I could perceive no reason for preferring
the one to the other. Antimonial medicines
seem better adapted to this than any
other sort of fever, and may be more freely
given in it.</p>

<p>These are the most likely means of bringing
about a remission; and if this is effected,
nothing remains to be done but to throw in
as much Peruvian bark as the stomach will
bear.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span></p>

<p>But whether from a fresh accumulation
of bile, or some other circumstance, it may
happen that the fever is kept up; and in
this case there is commonly a sense of weight
or uneasiness about the <i>hypochondria</i>, which
seems to indicate that the redundant bile is
in the gall bladder or ducts of the liver. In
this case a repetition of evacuants is necessary,
and calomel will be found to answer
remarkably well as a purgative, its stimulus
being so extensive as to loosen and bring
away bile when the saline purgatives, such
as that above mentioned, had failed of having
that effect. I have known these to
pass through the intestines without relieving
the uneasy sensation about the stomach as
calomel is found to do; and it will be still
more effectual for this purpose, if given alone
in a dose, from five to ten grains, and followed
some hours afterwards by some other
purgative. After this, antimonial medicines
are again to be had recourse to; and these,
as well as purgative and neutral medicines,
are safe and useful in a more advanced stage
of this fever than they are in the ship fever;
for the strength is not so apt to sink, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
the state of the bowels requires them more.
Antimonials, however, are to be used sparingly
and cautiously as the fever advances;
for I have known them, when given only a
few days after the first attack, to have the
effect, in some constitutions, of making the
stomach swell, and of producing a general
sense of heat and uneasiness.</p>

<p>After the evacuations of the bowels, the
anodyne diaphoretic may be very seasonably
given in the manner formerly mentioned;
for it will not only tend to sooth and procure
sleep after the commotion that has been
excited, but by its gentle sudorific effect will
assist in completing the remission.</p>

<p>The principal point of management in
the fevers of this climate is, to throw in
the Peruvian bark in proper season. I formerly
took occasion to differ from the opinion
of those who alledge that little or no
discrimination is necessary with regard to
the circumstances in which bark is proper
in continued fevers. I made fair and unprejudiced
trials of this, but always found that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
some sort of remission, especially towards
the beginning of the disease, was necessary,
in order to make the use of this medicine
safe and proper. The greatest vigilance is
indeed required that the administration of it
be not omitted when it is at all adviseable,
as the course of fevers is very quick and
critical in this climate. I have watched
many nights with some friends in whose
health I was particularly interested, to catch
the hour when it might be allowable to give
it; and where the propriety of it was somewhat
ambiguous, it was usual to qualify it
either by conjoining some antimonial or neutral
salt with the first doses, or by giving
them alternately with it, as has been formerly
mentioned.</p>

<p>Under the use of these means, the favourable
symptoms are, a warm moist skin, a
strong steady pulse, with the pulsations under
a hundred in a minute, a natural countenance,
and being free from delirium. But
if the fever should not yield during the first
week, but takes an unfavourable turn, the
pulse then becomes more small and frequent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
there is a general agitation, the tongue is
tremulous when put out, there is great thirst
and delirium, with a dry and hot skin. In
these circumstances, besides the continuation
of the antimonials in smaller doses,
with the anodyne diaphoretic, and the occasional
use of purgatives, blisters now become
proper; and we found also camphor combined
with nitre an excellent medicine at
this period of the disease.</p>

<p>Should the patient survive to the end of
the second week, the treatment then comes
to resemble more and more that of the infectious
fever already described. Bark may
be given, though there should be no proper
remission, and cordials and opiates may be
more freely used. Attention to the state of
the bowels will still be necessary, since repeated
accumulations of bile are apt to occur
even in the most advanced stage, and
gentle emetics of ipecacuana, as well as
laxatives, may be necessary. For the same
reason also, greater caution is requisite in
the use of pure opiates than in the infectious
ship fever before treated of. In order to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
keep the bowels soluble, it was a very usual
practice, and found very useful, to conjoin
a few grains of rhubarb with each dose of
the bark.</p>

<h4 id="OF_THE_YELLOW_FEVER">3. Of the <span class="smcap">Yellow Fever</span>.</h4>

<p>The fever last treated of may be said to
be peculiar to a hot climate; but the hot
seasons of temperate climates produce something
resembling it. That now to be described
never occurs, so far as I know, except
under the influence of tropical heats.
Such a fever is indeed known without the
tropics; for it is very common in Carolina
in the hot season; but there the heat is
even greater than that of the West Indies.
In order to produce it, there must be, for
some length of time, a heat seldom falling
below seventy-five degrees on Fahrenheit’s
thermometer.</p>

<p>Though it differs from the fever last described,
both in its causes and symptoms, it
is not meant to say that it is so distinct as to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
form a separate species of disease, like the
measles and small pox. Unless the characters
of fevers are strongly marked, it is difficult,
and even impossible, to refer them to
any particular species; and the different concurrence
of causes and constitutions is so
various, that great numbers of ambiguous
cases occur.</p>

<p>With regard to the cause of the yellow
fever, it differs from the bilious remittent
in this, that the air of woods and marshes
is not necessary to produce it; for it most
commonly arose from intemperance or too
much exercise in the heat of the sun. It
was observable, however, that it was more
apt to arise when, besides these causes, men
were exposed to unwholesome air, particularly
the foul air of ships, whether from infectious
effluvia, or proceeding merely from
the putrefaction that takes place in neglected
holds.</p>

<p>It is also remarkable with regard to it,
that it is confined almost entirely to those
who are newly come from a cold or temperate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
climate. The same remark is made by
the French, who therefore call it <i>fievre de
matelot</i><a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>, considering it as peculiarly incident
to those who have newly arrived from a long
voyage. It would appear also, from what
has been formerly mentioned<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> that those
men, who have been exposed to that sort of
infection that prevails in ships in cold climates
are more particularly the subjects of
the yellow fever when they arrive in a hot
climate. It is farther in proof of the same
opinion, that there are medical gentlemen,
natives of the West Indies, who have hardly
ever seen it, their practice lying at a distance
from any sea-port town where strangers
usually arrive. Of these strangers, those
who are young, fat, and plethoric, are most
apt to be attacked; and more of our officers
in proportion were seized with it than common
men.</p>

<p>It has been said, that it never attacks either
the female sex or blacks. This is in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
general, though not absolutely, true; for I
knew a black woman, who acted as nurse to
some men ill of this fever at Barbadoes,
who died with every symptom of it.</p>

<p>This fever assumes various forms, according
to the peculiar constitutions of different
men, and other circumstances; but in the
following description I shall enumerate the
most common appearances:&mdash;In general it
begins with short alternate chills and flushes
of heat, seldom with those rigors which
constitute the regular cold fit, and with
which most other fevers begin. These are
immediately succeeded by violent head-ach,
pain in the back, universal debility, sickness,
and anguish at the stomach. There is
commonly, in the beginning, a good deal of
bile on the stomach, which is thrown off
by vomiting, either natural or excited by
an emetic. Those men who were taken ill
of this fever in the Alcide, in the end of
the year 1781, had a sore throat in the beginning;
but this is not a common symptom.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span></p>

<p>In the course of this disease there is by
no means a free secretion of bile, and least
of all in those cases that are most violent,
and prove the soonest fatal. In cases that
are more protracted, and less desperate, there
are frequent accumulations of it, as appears
by the vomits and stools<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span></p>

<p>The eye in a few hours takes a yellow
tinge, which soon after extends more or less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
over the face and whole skin. This is a
symptom so striking and constant, that it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
gives name to the disease, though it is not
absolutely either peculiar or essential to it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
There is something contagious in this symptom,
which seems somewhat singular, and
difficult to be accounted for. It was observed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
in the Royal Oak and Alcide to extend
to men who were but slightly indisposed;
and at the hospital it spread to men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
in the adjoining beds, without imparting
any malignity to their diseases.</p>

<p>There is something very peculiar in the
countenances of those who are seized with
it, discernible from the beginning by those
who are accustomed to see it. This appearance
consists in a yellow or dingy flushing
or fullness of the face and neck, particularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
about the parotid glands, where the
yellow colour of the skin is commonly first
perceived. There is also in the eye and
muscles of the countenance a remarkable
expression of dejection and distress.</p>

<p>One of the most constant and distinguishing
symptoms of this fever is an obstinate,
unremitting, and painful <i>pervigilium</i>, which
is the more tormenting, as the patient is
extremely desirous of sleep. It is seldom
that even a <i>delirium</i> comes to his relief to
make him forget himself for a moment;
but he continues broad awake, night and
day, with his reason and senses sound, in a
state of the most uneasy agitation.</p>

<p>But the most distinguishing symptom, and
that which is expressive of the greatest danger,
is, an unconquerable irritability in the
stomach, which can be brought to bear nothing.
An almost incessant retching takes
place, which commonly, on the third day,
ends in what is called the <i>black vomit</i>, the
most hopeless of all the symptoms attending
it. When this is examined, the colour is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
found to be owing to small dark flakes, resembling
the grounds of coffee, and seems
to be blood which had oozed from the surface
of the stomach, a little altered. Indeed
pure blood is sometimes thrown up, and we
know that the red globules enter the smaller
order of vessels, and issue by them; for
bleeding at the nose is a common symptom
about this time; and some relate that it also
escapes by the ears and pores of the skin,
which I never saw, but can readily believe
it. At the same time, the stools grow
black, and the urine is frequently of a very
dark colour, which seem to be owing to
the same cause. I never remember to have
seen any one recover after these symptoms
came on.</p>

<p>There seems to be a general <i>error loci</i> of
the more tenacious and globular parts of the
blood into the smaller order of vessels, to
which the yellow colour is in a great measure
owing; and when any part of the skin
is ever so little pressed upon, a damask red
colour remains for some time, the small
vessels readily admitting the red globules.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
It is certain that a yellow colour of the skin
may be produced by such an <i>error loci</i>, without
any suspicion of the presence of bile.
We have an illustration of this in the ecchymosis
which follows upon an external
contusion. In this case the red part of the
blood is mechanically forced either into the
smaller order of vessels, or into the cellular
membrane, which occasions a livid appearance,
and in the course of the recovery the
same parts become yellow, probably in consequence
of some of the gluten of the blood
assuming this colour after the red parts have
been removed by absorption or otherwise.</p>

<p>In the worst form of this disease there is
all along an uncommonly distressing sensation
of universal anguish, particularly about
the stomach, where there is a sense of
burning heat, which, as the miserable sufferers
themselves express it, becomes unspeakable
torture.</p>

<p>A sense of weight at the breast, deep and
frequent sighing, and a great failure of muscular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
strength, are dangerous symptoms in
all stages of the disease.</p>

<p>Upon the first attack the skin is extremely
hot and dry, and the pulse hard and frequent;
but the external heat soon becomes
very little different from the usual standard
of health, and the skin feels soft and moist.
There sometimes happens an eruption of
small pustules, with white heads, on the
trunk of the body, which is a favourable
sign; and I have seen a head-ach disappear
upon this breaking out. The pulse does not
serve as an index of danger; for, after the
hurry of the first attack, it becomes very
moderate in point of frequency, varying
from eighty to a hundred pulsations in a minute,
and is natural in point of regularity
and strength.</p>

<p>In these circumstances this fever differs
from that which was last described; and it
also differs from it in being attended with
little delirium. I have seen cases in which
the senses were not affected from beginning
to end; and I never observed that violent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
and incessant delirium which attends other
dangerous fevers.</p>

<p>The state of the <i>fauces</i> is also different
from that of most other fevers, for there
is no excessive thirst. The tongue is somewhat
white and foul; but I do not remember
ever to have seen it black and dry.</p>

<p>A want of action in the bowels, and an
insensibility to purgative medicines, indicate
great danger; and, next to the black slimy
stools, one of the most unfavourable symptoms
is, when the <i>feces</i> are like white clay,
as I have seen in some cases that ran out to
the length of a week before they proved fatal.
When the black vomit and stools occur,
death commonly happens on the third
or fourth day. A bilious diarrhœa spontaneously
coming on, is a very favourable symptom.</p>

<p>In more unpromising cases the urine is
scanty, and in the last stage of life it becomes
of a very dark colour, as was mentioned
before. A plentiful secretion of urine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
is a very favourable circumstance, and seems
to be one of nature’s methods of curing the
disease; for such cases are observed to terminate
well. I remember one case in particular
in which several quarts were made
daily for several days together, and it was of
a very dark saffron colour, but looked green
where the surface was in contact with the
side of the pot. I inspissated a small quantity
of it, and found a large residuum,
which was very deliquescent, and seemed
to be all saline. In a hot climate the urine
does not shew that separation and deposition
which denote the crisis of fevers in cold climates,
and this is perhaps owing to there
being less mucilage and more alkali in the
former, on account of the more putrescent
state of the fluids. Upon adding a little
vinegar to the urine in the case above mentioned,
it became turbid like the critical
urine of the fevers of Europe.</p>

<p>At the approach of death, cold clammy
sweats come on; the pulse continues regular
and of a certain degree of strength, but
grows gradually slower. I have counted it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
at forty pulsations in a minute. The patient
is frequently sensible to the last moment;
nor does the countenance sink into what is
called the <i>Hippocratic</i> appearance. In other
cases I have seen, at this time, <i>coma</i>, and
not infrequently convulsions. Broad livid
spots sometimes also appear on the skin.
Extreme muscular debility, a great difficulty
of deglutition, and a dimness of the
eye-sight, are likewise common symptoms
in the last scene.</p>

<p>The different stages which lead to dissolution
following each other thus rapidly, there
is not that gradual failure of the powers of
nature that usually give warning of approaching
death; but the springs of life run
down, as it were, at once, the wretched
sufferer expires, and is happily delivered
from the most extreme misery of which
human nature is capable.</p>

<p>Such is the general train of symptoms in
this fever, taken entirely from my own observation;
but great varieties occur both in
the symptoms and duration, so great indeed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
that it is hardly recognisable for the same
disease. I shall give specimens of such anomalous
cases in two that occurred at Port
Royal, on board of the Canada, in July,
1782.</p>

<p>A lieutenant of that ship had been subject,
for four days, to fits of retching, without
any bilious discharge or pain in the stomach;
and, except a white tongue, he had no
symptom of fever in that time, nor any
thing to prevent him from doing his duty.
On the fourth day, when I first saw him,
he began to complain of a fixed pain in the
pit of the stomach, which was not very
violent, and about the same time a yellowness
began to appear on the white of the
eye. He took a laxative medicine, which
had the desired effect, and some volatile spirits,
with some drops of thebaic tincture in
simple mint water, for the pain in his stomach.
He had a good night. Next day
the complaint of the stomach was better;
but there was great muscular debility. He
had several natural stools; and as there seemed
little indication but debility, he took nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
that day except an infusion of some
bitters and aromatics in wine. As he did
not want for appetite, he eat some broth
and chicken; and nothing to give any alarm
happened this day, except a short qualm,
in which he was faint, with a sense of cold,
feeling to himself, as he said, as if he
should have expired. In the afternoon he
began to have black-coloured stools, which
was the first symptom that clearly betrayed
the nature of the disease. He was then ordered
as much Peruvian bark as he could
take with red wine, and these his stomach
bore. Decoction of bark was also given
him in clysters. He had a strong voice,
and was quite sensible, but grew weaker
and weaker with frequent returns of the
qualms, and he expired that evening before
ten o’clock.</p>

<p>I have not the least hesitation in ranking
this case with the fevers last described,
though so many of the usual symptoms were
wanting. This gentleman, though of a
lively, active disposition, was of a slender
make, and of a dingy, doughy complection,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
and his case gave me the idea of a disease attacking
a constitution which, not having
powers to struggle with it, is overwhelmed
without making resistance<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>. In those robust,
plethoric habits, which are most commonly
attacked, there is a sufficient degree
of strength to excite the violent symptoms
before enumerated.</p>

<p>A few days after this gentleman’s death,
another officer of the same ship was taken ill
with the same sort of fever, and it was also
attended with several unusual symptoms.
Neither his skin nor eyes were yellow; the
skin was hot and dry throughout the disease,
and during the three first days there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
was a diarrhœa, which was neither bilious,
putrid, nor mucous, but consisted in watery
stools. There were no gripes, nor any
local pains whatever; but I never remember
to have seen more suffering from that
general anguish, particularly about the stomach,
which attends this sort of fever. On
the third night he began to vomit and purge
blood, which soon terminated in that dark-coloured
discharge which is a symptom so
characteristic and fatal in this disease. He
continued sensible till within eight hours of
his death, which happened on the fourth
night. The pulse was full and pretty
strong during the whole course of the disease;
but there was all along great debility
and frequent sighing, symptoms that ought
always to create alarm.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment of the Yellow Fever.</span></h4>

<p>I feel this as the most painful and
discouraging part of this work, the yellow
fever being one of the most fatal diseases to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
which the human body is subject, and in
which human art is the most unavailing.</p>

<p>It seems hardly to admit of a doubt that
there are particular instances of disease, in
their own nature, <i>determinedly fatal</i>, that is,
in which the animal functions are from the
beginning so deranged, that there are no
possible means in nature capable of controlling
that series of morbid motions which
lead to dissolution. Of this kind appear to
be the greatest number of cases of the
plague, many of the malignant small pox,
and some of fevers, particularly of that kind
now under consideration. It is extremely
difficult to ascertain such cases from observation;
and it may be said that the opinion
of the existence of them is favourable to
ignorance and indolence. But, on the other
hand, it may be questioned if more harm is
not likely to arise in medicine by being too
sanguine and officious, than by a diffidence
of art and trusting to the powers of unassisted
nature? Were we thoroughly acquainted
with the animal œconomy, we should perceive
<i>&agrave; priori</i> in what instances the seeds of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
disease would either operate so as necessarily
to terminate in death, or when they were
within the command of art. But we can
derive little or no information from this
source, on account of our great ignorance
of the secret operations of the living body;
so that the only grounds of judging are our
observation and experience concerning the
usual event of disease, and the effects of remedies.
Though these are circumstances
attended with great uncertainty and ambiguity,
yet I believe it will be admitted as
the opinion of the most chaste and experienced
observers, that there do really exist
diseases whose course cannot be diverted by
any means that can be employed. This
opinion, I have said, is, in one view, extremely
discouraging; yet, to the mind of
a feeling and conscientious practitioner, who
must often find his best endeavours baffled
in many diseases as well as this, and who
might be apt to look back and accuse himself
of some fault or omission, it affords
this satisfaction to his reflections, that the
want of success may have been owing to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
something in the nature of the disease, and
not to his want of skill and attention.</p>

<p>But though the fatality of this disease is
discouraging, let us not despond, but rather
redouble our diligence in observing what assistance
and relief nature may admit of.</p>

<p>It is proper in this as in every other fever
of this climate, to begin the cure by cleansing
the first passages. This does not produce
the same relief as in the common bilious
fever, probably because there is a less
free secretion of bile, and therefore less oppression
from the collection of it.</p>

<p>With regard to blood-letting, the most
that can be said in its favour is, that if
there should be a hard throbbing pulse, with
violent pain in the head and back, it is <i>safe</i>
in the first twelve hours. This limitation
is necessary, at least with regard to common
seamen, who do not bear evacuations so well
as officers and others, who are used to a better
diet, and to whom the loss of blood has,
in some cases, been found useful in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
early stage of this fever. It is, however, in
all cases extremely dangerous, except in the
circumstances mentioned above. The blood
is said to shew a buff in the beginning of the
disease, but in the second stage, it is mentioned
by a French author<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>, that it hardly
coagulates or separates. But even the appearance
of a buff, without considering other
circumstances, does not always argue the
propriety of blood-letting<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>.</p>

<p>The great object in the cure of this fever
is, to bring the stomach to bear the bark.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
There are here wanting most of the circumstances
that in the other cases forbid the
use of it; for there is no preternatural
quantity of bile in the stomach and intestines,
nor is there a hot and dry skin, nor
violent delirium. The only obstacle to its
administration is the great irritability of the
stomach, which is the most fatal symptom
of the disease; and the principal part of the
management of the patient consists in the
prevention or removal of this. The stomach
is to be treated with the utmost tenderness
and attention. One gentle emetic
at the beginning is all that is allowable;
and as fresh collections of bile are less apt to
occur, the repetition of it is less necessary.</p>

<p>It is best to abstain altogether from antimonial
medicines, and to render every thing,
whether food, drink, or medicine, as grateful
as possible. The liquid most apt to stay
upon the stomach is the juice of the acid
fruits of the climate, such as<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> oranges and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
lemons. It happens frequently, however,
that acids come to be loathed extremely, so
as to nauseate the stomach and to encourage
retching. In this case I have found a composition
of wine and water with lemon juice
and nutmeg, sweetened with sugar, and given
warm, to be a very grateful and salutary
drink. The patient sometimes prefers the
decoction of farinaceous substances to every
other liquid; and in one case in particular,
which did well, the patient was led by taste
to prefer warm water gruel to every thing
else, and the great quantity he drank seemed
to have a considerable share in his recovery,
by keeping up a warm moist skin and producing
a great flow of urine.</p>

<p>In order to check vomiting, the saline
draught, in the act of effervescence, has been
employed with evident advantage; but in
most cases this symptom is so obstinate as
to discourage all attempts to remove it. I
have known magnesia in mint water have a
visible effect in soothing the stomach, particularly
when given immediately after some
acid beverage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span></p>

<p>I was informed by Dr. Young, physician
to the army, that he found an infusion of
cham&aelig;mile flowers one of the best medicines
in this vomiting; and a surgeon of one of
the line-of-battle ships informed me, that he
also found advantage from it in alleviating
this symptom. The French author above
mentioned affirms, that milk, boiled with
some flour or bread, given in the quantity
of a spoonful at a time, and frequently repeated,
had more effect than any thing he
tried in stopping the vomiting in this fever.
I have seen this symptom relieved by fomenting
the stomach with stupes wrung
from the decoction of bark, and sprinkled
with camphorated spirits and tincture of
bark<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>.</p>

<p>But nothing I have ever seen tried had so
great an effect in removing this irritability
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
of stomach as a blister applied to it externally;
and it is a remedy which, so
far as I know, has not been hitherto recommended.
In other fevers, when the
head was not particularly affected, I preferred
this part for the application of a blister,
for it is in some respects more convenient
than between the shoulders, and the
stomach is the part more affected perhaps
than any other in all fevers. But in this
fever I was led to apply it to this part, both
from its being affected in an uncommon degree,
and from observing, upon inspecting
the bodies of those who died, that the only
morbid appearance that could be discovered
was an inflammatory suffusion on the inner
membranes of the stomach.</p>

<p>I have employed opiates both externally
and internally to allay this symptom, but
without the effect that might have been expected
from so powerful a sedative.</p>

<p>As the stomach will seldom, even in the
most favourable cases, bear such a quantity
of bark as to subdue the disease, it must be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
exhibited in every other way that can be
thought of, such as by clyster and by external
fomentation, both of which I have
employed with good effect. I used to order
a pint of decoction of bark to be injected
every three or four hours, and the fomentation
to be employed nearly as often. I have
heard of the decoction of bark being used as
a warm bath with success; but I cannot
decide concerning this practice from my
own experience.</p>

<p>I have no other internal remedy to recommend;
for whatever power of retention the
stomach may have should be employed in
taking bark. If it should become tolerably
retentive, camphor will be found of service;
and if given in the evening with an
opiate, perspiration and sleep will probably
be procured, by which the patient will be
greatly relieved.</p>

<p>Blisters to the thighs and legs seemed to
coincide with the general intention of cure,
and they appeared to be of advantage in the
cases in which they were tried.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span></p>

<h4 id="INTERMITTENT_FEVERS">4. Of the Effects of Flowers of Zinc and
White Vitriol in the Cure of obstinate
<span class="smcap">Intermittent Fevers</span>.</h4>

<p>It frequently happens in the West Indies
that intermittent fevers are so obstinate
as to resist the common means of cure by
the Peruvian bark; so that these complaints
become extremely distressing to the medical
practitioner as well as to the patient. Indeed
this was a difficulty that occurred so
often, that I was sometimes tempted to
think, either that the great reputation of
this medicine is not so well founded as is
commonly believed, or that the bark generally
in use in these times is not of so good
a quality as that employed by the physicians
who first established its character.</p>

<p>But, in the first place, the experience upon
which its reputation was first built was in a
temperate climate, where very few agues
are found to resist it when properly administered.
In the next place, there is reason to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
believe that, in fact, the medicine itself now
commonly in use is not equally powerful
with what was first employed; and a species
of it, called the Red Peruvian Bark,
has lately been discovered, or rather, perhaps,
revived, which is certainly of a superior
quality, and has been found to cure intermittents
in which the common sort had
failed<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>.</p>

<p>However this may be, it is an undoubted
fact that obstinate agues are much more frequent
in the West Indies than in Europe;
and something to supply the insufficiency of
the bark seemed to be a <i>desideratum</i>.</p>

<p>I was informed by Dr. Hendy, of Barbadoes,
that he had found the flowers of zinc
to answer in cases of intermittent fever, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
which even the bark and every other remedy
and mode of treatment had failed. It was
found very successful in the like cases, both
in my own trials at the hospitals, and by
the surgeons of the men of war to whom I
recommended the use of it. In order to
judge what may be expected from it, I shall
give a specimen of its success in some cases,
at the hospital at St. Lucia, of which I kept
an accurate account, in the months of February
and March, 1783.</p>

<p>About the time the fleet arrived there,
six cases of intermittent fevers were sent to
the hospital from different ships. One was
of six weeks continuance, and had been
some times of the tertian, sometimes of the
quartan type. Two were quartans; one of
which was of two months, the other of
eight months duration. Two were regular
tertians; of which one had only had two
fits, but was a relapse after a week’s exemption
from an attack of several weeks. The
other was of three months continuance, attended
with an eruption on the hands and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
arms. The sixth case was a quotidian of
three weeks, attended with a cough of the
same standing, and joined with sea scurvy.</p>

<p>In all of them the bark had been given
at some period or other; and the flowers of
zinc were now tried in all, except the last.
In three out of the five this medicine had
the most visible good effects. In one the
disease was so speedily removed, that there
was only one fit after the first day of taking
this medicine, and the other two had recovered
perfectly after it had been used for seven
days.</p>

<p>In these cases there can be little or no
ambiguity with regard to the real efficacy of
the medicine, as the disease had lasted from
two to six months, and there was no other
circumstance of change in the situation or
treatment of the patients that could account
for their recovery.</p>

<p>Of the two cases in which it failed, one
was the tertian of three months, attended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
with the eruption; the other was the relapsed
tertian of three days.</p>

<p>With regard to the dose, I began with
giving it in the quantity of two grains
thrice a day, which, in some, produced the
desired effect, and without the least sensible
operation on the stomach or bowels. If
this dose did not stop the fits after a few
days trial, it was increased to three grains,
which, in some, would produce a little sickness.
I found that four grains ruffled the
stomach a good deal; but if the patient is
gradually habituated to it, even more than
this may be given without inconvenience.</p>

<p>In those cases in which it was successful
it was not found necessary to give more
than two grains at a dose, except in one of
them, in which three were given the day
before the fit ceased. In the two unsuccessful
cases the medicine had a fair trial for a
fortnight; but one of them getting no better,
and the other seeming to get worse, it
was left off.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span></p>

<p>The cases to which this medicine is
adapted are those that have extremely distinct
remissions, with no symptoms of bile
nor any local affection. When agues come
to be long protracted, they are frequently
what may be called nervous; that is, consisting
of certain morbid motions that seem
to be induced by habit, after the original
cause is removed, and with a tolerable enjoyment
of appetite, sleep, and all the functions
of life, during the intermission.</p>

<p>The two cases in which the zinc failed
recovered by the use of the bark. This
had been unsuccessfully tried before, and its
good effects now might either depend on its
having been left off for some time, whereby
the body recovered its sensibility to its virtues,
or it might be in consequence of administering
it in ardent spirits with a few
grains of capsicum and ginger, additions
which I found to improve its effects in other
cases, and is a mode of giving it well suited
to this climate.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span></p>

<p>The zinc was not tried in the sixth case,
on account of the local affection and the remission
being short and imperfect.</p>

<p>The white vitriol, being a salt of zinc,
might be supposed to possess the same virtues;
and it would appear to do so from
some facts<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> that were reported to me in the
West Indies, and also from some trials made
by me at St. Thomas’s hospital since I came
to England.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span></p>

<p>Though this is a medicine of very considerable
powers, I do not mean to put it in
competition with the bark, by proposing it
as a substitute for it, or by representing it
as superior to it in all circumstances; but
only to propose it as a valuable subsidiary in
particular cases. The account I have given
is faithfully extracted from a diary of my
practice; and were I to say more in its favour
than the future experience of others
may warrant, I should do more harm than
service to its reputation. Many good medicines
have had their characters hurt by being
over-rated by the first proposers of them,
who are naturally sanguine and partial, without,
perhaps, intending to deceive. But
when others find that their virtues do not
come up to what has been asserted, they are
apt to run into the other extreme, and explode
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
them altogether; so that what was
given out as good for every thing, is now
found to be good for nothing<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>.

<h2 id="PART_III_CHAP_II">CHAP. II.</h2>

<h3 id="OF_FLUXES" class="medium">Of <span class="smcap">Fluxes</span>.</h3>

<p>These seem to arise in the same circumstances,
and to be owing to the same
general causes, as fevers. They may, in
some sense, be considered as fevers, attended
with peculiar symptoms in consequence of a
determination to the bowels, just as fevers
in cold climates are sometimes attended with
rheumatism and catarrh. We have seen, in
the first part of this work, that the dysentery
arose chiefly in those ships which had
been subject to fevers.</p>

<p>This determination to the bowels is owing
to a variety of causes, but is chiefly connected
with external heat; for it is most common
in hot climates, and towards the end
of summer or in the autumns of cold climates,
owing probably to a greater acrimony
of the secretions of the intestines, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
particularly of the bile. Dysenteries arise
in camps also at the same seasons, and in the
same circumstances as bilious fevers<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>.</p>

<p>Besides climate and season, the other circumstances
determining to the one disease
more than the other are, 1. A difference in
the constitutions of different men; for in
the same ship it sometimes happens that
both diseases prevail equally, though all the
men are using the same diet and breathing
the same air. 2. The nature of the occasional
cause. A dysentery, for instance, is
more likely to arise from an irregularity in
eating or drinking; a fever from being exposed
to the weather, particularly marsh effluvia.
3. The particular species of infection
that may happen to be introduced.
Suppose, for example, that a ship’s company
is predisposed to acute distempers, and one
man or more ill of the dysentery should be
brought on board, this will become the prevailing
disease, as happened in the Torbay
in August, 1780. If the like number of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
fevers should be introduced, then fevers will
be the prevailing disease.</p>

<p>These two diseases may therefore be considered
as <i>vicarious</i>, the one substituting itself
for the other according to particular accidents,
and both proceeding from the same
general causes; and this is no new idea of
mine, but seems to have been Dr. Sydenham’s,
when he calls the dysentery a <i>febris
introversa</i>. It may be farther added, that
dysentery is the latest form in which this
cause, which is common to both, can exert
itself; for it is a disease more within the
reach of art; and some of the most dangerous
symptoms attending fevers, particularly
<i>delirium</i>, seldom occur in dysentery.
When it proves fatal, it is in consequence
of violent local affection, and that in general
after it has taken a chronic form. When
an incipient fever turns into a dysentery, all
the symptoms, and particularly the head-ach,
delirium, and <i>coma</i>, if there should be
any, are immediately relieved. And the
most favourable cases of the yellow fever are
those in which a bilious diarrhœa comes on,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
while the most fatal are those in which the
bowels are so torpid as to be insensible to
any stimulus either from their own contents
or from medicine.</p>

<p>I shall not enter into a minute description
of this disease in all its stages, as this has
been so ably executed by Sir John Pringle,
Sir George Baker, and other authors, but
shall only give a sketch of some of the most
remarkable symptoms, particularly such as
are peculiar to the climate and manner of
life, so as to explain the varieties that may
be necessary in the mode of treatment.</p>

<p>The fluxes that arose in the fleet were
either what may be called the acute idiopathic
dysenteries, or a dysenteric state of the
bowels from neglected diarrhœas, which was
most apt to occur in the convalescent state
of fevers, or in men labouring under the
scurvy. The body is more susceptible of
infection in a state of weakness from these
or any other causes; and in hot climates
the dysentery seems to be more infectious
than fevers; for at hospitals it was so frequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
communicated to men who were ill
of other complaints, that it was in these
the principal cause of mortality. For this
reason, I was at more pains with regard to
this disease than any other, in keeping those
who were ill of it in a separate ward.</p>

<p>I have met with some violent and untractable
cases which proved fatal in the acute
state; but, in general, this disease draws out
to a chronic form in this climate, and does
not prove mortal for many weeks. The
usual cause of death appears, from the inspection
of the bodies, to be an ulceration of
the great intestines, particularly of the descending
colon and the rectum. This part
of the intestinal tube is most affected from
its being the receptacle of all the acrid secretions
from the rest of the canal; and it
is naturally more subject to congestions of
the fluids and incurable ulcers, as appears
from the rectum being so liable to the h&aelig;morrhoids
and the <i>fistula</i>. This ulceration
of the great intestines is so common, that,
out of eight cases which I inspected after
death, seven had this appearance. The case
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
in which there was none was not so much
a case of dysentery as of inflamed bowels,
brought on by the man having drank to
excess of spirits while he was recovering
from a dysentery. The acute <i>tormina</i> which
always occur in the first days of the disease
seem owing to an inflammation, which terminates
in ulcers; and these being constantly
irritated by the sharp humours, produce the
<i>tenesmus</i>, which is the symptom most essential
to dysentery in the after part of the disease.
Any diarrhœa may in this manner
become dysenteric. During the acute griping
at the beginning, the stools are loose
and copious; but as soon as the tenesmus
takes place, they are scanty, which is most
probably owing to the spasmodic strictures
in the great intestines, in consequence of
irritation upon their excoriated surface. The
inflammatory state is more lasting and violent
in a cold than a hot climate, the gripings
are more severe, and the danger is
also greater in this stage of it.</p>

<p>The state which the great intestines fall
into in old dysenteries seems to have something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
in it peculiar to itself: the several
coats become thick and spongy; their texture
is obliterated and destroyed; and they
become of a black or very dark purple colour.
This, however, cannot be called mortification;
for the fibres of the gut do not
lose their tenacity, nor is there that putrid
and dissolved state in which gangrene consists;
but it advances in time to such an extreme
state of disease as to be entirely incapable
of recovering its natural appearance
and functions, and proves therefore the cause
of death.</p>

<p>The greater frequency and obstinacy of
these chronic fluxes in hot than in cold climates
seems to be owing to the same weakening
of the powers of life which make
recovery in general so tedious, and particularly
that of wounds and ulcers. The
greater quantity of acrid bile will also tend
to keep up the ulceration. Dysenteries have
this disadvantage, that the Peruvian bark,
which is the most powerful restorative in
other complaints of this climate, is here
found to be inadmissible on account of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
heat, thirst, and other febrile symptoms,
which it seldom fails to induce in all stages
of this disease.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment</span> of <span class="smcap">Fluxes</span>.</h4>

<p>There are few diseases in which a
prudent employment of art is more useful,
or in which early means of relief are more
requisite than in this<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>.</p>

<p>Where the dysentery is the original disease,
and when the patient is robust and
plethoric, with acute pain and a strong
pulse, blood-letting may be practised with
advantage in the beginning of the complaint.
But there is no part of the practice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
in this disease in which the climate and
manner of life makes a greater difference
than in this; for in a temperate climate it
frequently happens that repeated blood-letting
is necessary; but in a hot climate, where
the fibres are relaxed, and in the constitutions
of seamen, whom we seldom or never
find plethoric, the inflammatory symptoms
requiring this evacuation do not run so high,
nor continue so long.</p>

<p>It is in all cases of the utmost consequence
to administer as early as possible a brisk saline
purgative. An ounce and a half or two
ounces of purging salts may be dissolved in
a quart of barley water or water gruel, and
given warm in cupfuls, at small intervals,
till a free and copious evacuation is produced.
If there should be much fever, or
sickness at stomach, two grains of emetic
tartar will be a great improvement of this
medicine; and there will be this farther
advantage from its use, that if the stomach
should be loaded with bile, in which state
it is more irritable, an evacuation upwards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
will also be excited to the great relief of the
patient.</p>

<p>This early and seasonable measure will,
in many cases, put a stop to the disease,
especially if the patient is thrown into a
sweat immediately after the bowels have
been thus thoroughly evacuated. It is of
great service in this disease to promote free
perspiration, and even a plentiful sweat,
which may be effected with great advantage
by giving, at bed time, a medicine composed
of opium, ipecacuana, and a little
neutral salt, accompanying it with plentiful
warm dilution. Nothing tends more to relieve
griping and tenesmus than a general,
warm moisture on the skin. The ipecacuana,
which is an ingredient in this medicine, is
one of the best anti-dysenteric remedies we
know; the opium procures rest; and this,
joined to the sudorific effect of the whole,
not only gives a temporary relief, but tends
to carry off the disease. It is most properly
given in the evening; for there would be
this inconvenience in constantly encouraging
a sweat, that if the tenesmus should return,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
it would either be checked by the patient
getting frequently out of bed, or there would
be danger of his catching cold. I am well
aware that we cannot be too cautious with
regard to the use of opium in the beginning
of this disease; but it is admissible more
early in a hot climate than a cold one, as
the inflammatory symptoms are less violent
and can be sooner subdued; besides, it becomes
an entirely different medicine when
conjoined with the other ingredients that
have been mentioned.</p>

<p>The best medicine in the day time we
found to be small doses of ipecacuana alone
twice or thrice a day; and if there should
be fresh collections of bile, small doses of
the saline purgative will be necessary. Ipecacuana
in this intention, may be given in
the dose of two grains in athletic constitutions,
such as those of seamen; but in the
more delicate constitutions, such as are commonly
met with in private practice, one
grain is a sufficient dose. I have found
manna and tamarinds a good addition to this
medicine in the earlier stages of the disease,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
where there was much bile; but in a more
advanced stage of it they are apt to produce
gripings and flatulence.</p>

<p>The marks of a redundance of bile are, a
sickness at stomach, a sense of scalding at
the anus when the stools are passing, and
the yellow or green colour of the stools
themselves. It is apt also to excite symptoms
of fever, such as a foul tongue, a hot
and dry skin, with thirst. When collections
of it are suspected in this disease, it is best
to evacuate it by vomiting, for it is thereby
prevented from irritating the bowels, and
from arriving at the inflamed parts with,
perhaps, increased acrimony, acquired in
passing through the whole length of the
intestines.</p>

<p>Some gentlemen of the fleet informed me
that they found oil of almonds a useful addition
to the purgative. Others as well as
myself made a practical comparison of the saline
purgative with that composed of rhubarb
and calomel, as recommended by Sir John
Pringle, and we gave the preference to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
former, as more easy, speedy, and effectual in
its operation, especially in the first stage. Cases
may occur, however, in which the other may
be more advisable; for where there is a sense
of weight about the stomach, which most
probably arises from the biliary organs being
clogged with bile, and where emetics
have failed to remove it, or the weakness of
the patient may render them improper, then
calomel has the best effect: for it was formerly
observed, that it tends to loosen the
secretions, and to stimulate the more distant
excretories, such as the biliary ducts.</p>

<p>It is very important to caution young
practitioners concerning the employment of
opium in all stages of this disease, but especially
in the beginning; for though it is an
excellent remedy when seasonably and judiciously
employed, it is very liable to abuse,
particularly in the hands of the inexperienced,
who may be tempted to give it improperly
from an anxiety to relieve; but as
more harm may arise from an unseasonable
administration of it than could be compensated
by the best-timed use of it, it is best
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
to err on the side of caution and omission.
The principal caution to be observed with
regard to this remedy is, to premise suitable
evacuation, such as blood-letting, if necessary,
but more especially purging. It is
always pernicious to give it in its pure state
during the <i>tormina</i>, so common in the first
days. By these I mean the abdominal gripings,
which denote inflammation, and are
entirely different from the <i>tenesmus</i>, which
is a more constant and characteristic symptom
of the disease, and seems to arise from
irritation and spasms of the rectum and
colon.</p>

<p>It was in this disease that I first observed
the good effects of a small quantity of neutral
salt in taking off the inconveniencies
attending opium, such as the feverish heat
and confusion of the head, which it is apt
to produce in many constitutions; and as
the administration of the anodyne coincided
with the evening dose of ipecacuana, I was
led to adopt a form similar to that of Dover’s
powder, but with only half the quantity
of opium; or, it was given in a liquid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
form, by combining twenty drops of thebaic
tincture and a drachm of ipecacuana
wine, with nitre from five to ten grains, in
any simple vehicle in form of a draught.
There is a very observable difference, in
some cases, between opium given in a liquid
and in a solid form; and the former is much
more certain in its effect when the intention
is to procure speedy and effectual ease.</p>

<p>I have observed great benefit from the use
of external remedies in dysentery, and these
have, perhaps, been too much neglected by
authors and practitioners. The warm bath
is of great service, especially where the
gripes and tenesmus are severe, and where
the fever has been taken off by previous
evacuation. Fomentations or warm applications
of any kind to the abdomen give
temporary relief; and it will be found of
advantage to keep those parts, at all times,
well defended from the cold air. Blisters to
the abdomen were also found of use, and
likewise acrid liniments, composed of oil,
volatile spirits, and tincture of cantharides.
Where the stomach has been much affected,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
I have perceived relief from fomenting it
with stupes, upon which thebaic tincture
and camphorated spirits were sprinkled, as
recommended by Dr. Lind. I was once affected
with a bad dysentery in the West Indies,
and I thought myself much relieved
by the warm bath and a blister. Strangury
is not an uncommon symptom in this disease,
independent of cantharides, and the
most sensible and effectual relief is derived
from fomentations to the pubis and perin&aelig;um,
as I also experienced in my own case.</p>

<p>What has been hitherto said regards
chiefly the acute dysentery; but the most
frequent and troublesome complaint that
occurred at the hospital, was the same disease
in what may be called its chronic state.</p>

<p>There is a considerable variety of symptoms
in all the stages of this disease, but
particularly in the more advanced or chronic
state, so that a corresponding variety is
necessary in the modes of treatment, and
there are few diseases in which there is more
room for exercising the judgement.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span></p>

<p>In all stages of it an accurate discernment
is necessary with regard to the use of opiates,
and great part of the practice here consists in
timing these well. They are least admissible
in the beginning, where evacuation is the
principal object; but as the disease advances
they become more and more allowable and
useful. The principal cautions necessary
in their administration are, 1. To premise
sufficient evacuation, so that the intestines
may not be loaded with bile, <i>scybala</i>, or
any other irritating matter at the time of
giving the opiate. 2. To obviate the effects
which an anodyne has of causing a
retention of the contents of the intestines.
This may be done, either by giving something
purgative along with it, or after it
has produced its quieting effect. The former
method seems preferable; for as soon as the
effect of the opiate is over, the purgative
is ready to act; and in this way it is so far
favourable to the operation of the purgative
that large feculent stools will be discharged:
whereas, had the purgative been given alone,
it would have been more apt to produce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
scanty griping stools, attended with tenesmus.
Rhubarb answers well in such cases,
and may be given in a dose from twelve to
twenty grains, according to the age and
constitution. 3. To prevent feverish heat
and delirium. This was proposed to be done
in the first stage of the disease, by combining
it with ipecacuana and a little neutral
salt. With the same intention, it may now
be joined with a few grains of Dr. James’s
powder, or <i>vitrum ceratum antimonii</i>, in which
form it would not be so strongly sudorific,
an effect not so much required in the chronic
as in the acute state.</p>

<p>The principal causes that keep up the
flux, and render it so obstinate, are, 1. A
too great secretion of bile, either continual
or frequently recurring. 2. Ulcers in the
great intestines. 3. A lienteric state of the
bowels. 4. A retention of <i>scybala</i>.</p>

<p>The first cause is much less frequent than
might be expected by those who fancy that
every disease of this climate proceeds from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
bile. When there does occur a redundancy
of bile, there is more occasion for the employment
of evacuant medicines, and more
need of caution in that of opiates. A medicine
that will dispose the liver, or the circulating
system in general, to form less bile, is a <i>desideratum</i>
in physic; but, in case of an excessive
flow of it, emetics and mercurial purgatives,
as has been already mentioned, are
the best means of evacuating it; and care
should be taken that it be discharged before
it accumulates too much, or becomes acrid
by too long retention.</p>

<p>In order to obviate that irritation in which
tenesmus consists, some benefit was found
from the injection of emollient and anodyne
clysters, to wash off and dilute the acrimony,
and to sooth and heal the parts. A
strong infusion or decoction of linseed or
starch may first be given to the quantity of
near a pint, to be evacuated after a short retention,
and then a few ounces of the same,
with thirty or forty drops of laudanum, to
be retained for a length of time, in order to
procure rest. Instead of this last, I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
known a small quantity of warm milk, with
syrup of poppies, used with advantage in
private practice.</p>

<p>I was at first tempted to think that a very
frequent injection of such clysters would be
very useful, by washing and healing the colon
and rectum, and preventing farther exulceration.
But besides the objection arising
from the tenderness of the parts, which, in
some cases, renders the operation itself painful,
I found that if they were given oftener
than once a day, they rather increased the
uneasiness, and made the patient feel languid
and exhausted; so true it is that no
practical rule can be established from reason
alone without being brought to the test of
experience. The rectum seems to have a
peculiar sensibility, and a remarkable consent
with the whole system; for a stool will
induce syncope, or even death, in a state of
great debility. Clysters may be pernicious,
even though they produce no evacuation of
<i>feces</i>; and Sydenham has remarked, with respect
to other diseases, that their unseasonable
or too frequent use greatly debilitates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
and disturbs the patient. When not abused,
however, they are of the most eminent service
in this and other complaints.</p>

<p>Certain medicines, which have been called
<i>sheathing</i>, have been recommended to be taken
by the mouth. Of this kind are mucilage,
oil, and wax. I have made trial of
mucilage, such as starch, without any sensible
effect, probably because it loses its qualities
by the powers of digestion before it
reaches the part upon which it is intended
to act. With regard to oil, I have hardly
enough of experience of my own to decide;
but some of the surgeons of the fleet informed
me that they found advantage from
combining it with the purgatives. I was
discouraged from using it by finding that it
was apt, in the West Indies, to become rancid
on the stomach, and, for this reason, I
seldom, in any case, employed the castor
oil, which, though produced in that climate,
seems to answer better as a medicine
in Europe. But since my return to England
I have used, with great benefit, at St.
Thomas’s hospital, a medicine, composed of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
tincture of rhubarb and oil, in old dysenteries,
attended with discharges of blood. I
took the hint of this from finding it of
great service in deep-seated piles, as recommended
by Dr. Griffith<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>. It is necessary
to combine something purgative with the
oil, otherwise it might be altered by digestion,
or absorbed, or might become rancid
by too long retention in the first passages.
Wax is a body not changeable by digestion,
and seems therefore well suited for the purpose
of sheathing the bowels; and I have
found advantage from the preparation of it
recommended by Sir John Pringle<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>, on
the authority of Dr. Huck. I have also
seen some advantage in old fluxes, in St.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
Thomas’s hospital, from the use of spermaceti,
given with an equal quantity of
conserve of roses and half as much absorbent
powder, agreeably to a form in use at
that hospital.</p>

<p>The climate has a great influence in preventing
these ulcers from healing, upon the
same principle that it prevents the cure of
external sores and wounds, so that there are
cases that admit of no cure but from a
change of climate. I have seen in some
cases of old dysentery, small, round, ill-conditioned
ulcers break out on the surface
of the body, which seemed to proceed from
the same general habit that produced those
of the intestines. There was something
peculiar in the appearance of those external
sores, being like small round pits, as if a
part of the skin had been removed by caustic,
and with little or no discharge. In a
case of this kind, which proved fatal, I
found the whole surface of the great intestines
beset with small ulcers, not unlike
those on the skin.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span></p>

<p>Since the first edition of this work was
published, I have met with a pamphlet,
written by Dr. Houlston, of Liverpool, in
which the friction of mercurial ointment
on the abdomen is recommended as a cure
for old fluxes; and I have tried this practice
in some very obstinate cases in St. Thomas’s
hospital with evident success. In these
cases it is probable the disease is kept up by
a vitiated state of some of the various secretions
belonging to the intestinal canal, which
the mercurial alternative tends to correct.</p>

<p>The next cause that was mentioned of the
long continuation of fluxes, was a lienteric
state of the bowels. This consists in a great
irritability of the whole alimentary canal,
whereby all the <i>ingesta</i> are transmitted so
fast, that there is no time for assimilation.
Liquid aliment, such as broth, is particularly
subject to this inconvenience. There
are few cases of long-protracted fluxes in
the West Indies, without this symptom in
some degree.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span></p>

<p>The remedies that are here found of most
service are such as counteract irritability or
relaxation. It is in cases where this is the
prevalent symptom that opium may be most
freely used. Frequent and small doses of
the compound officinals, such as theriaca,
pulvis e bolo compositus, or diascordium,
have been found of service. Though the
relaxation would seem here to indicate the
Peruvian bark, yet I have hardly ever known
it employed in any form in this or any other
stage of the disease, without being hurtful.
But there are other bitters not only safe but
useful in restoring the tone of the bowels;
of this kind are simaruba, quassia, and chamomile
flowers. The first has been reckoned
a specific in this sort of flux; but
though its powers are undeniable, it will be
found frequently to fail<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>. I have also used,
with advantage, a tincture of gentian and
cinnamon in Port wine. Something aromatic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
has a good effect when added to the
bitter, being adapted to prevent or obviate
flatulence, which is a common and troublesome
symptom in this complaint.</p>

<p>That class of remedies which may be
called pure astringents, might seem at first
sight well calculated for cases of this kind.
Of this sort are the <i>terra Japonica</i> and <i>extractum
campechense</i>; but though I have seen
evident benefit from this last, there are few
cases in which such medicines are found by
experience to be of material service. Where
the cause consists in simple relaxation, they
will effect a cure; but it more frequently
happens that the disease is kept up by a vitiated
state of the secretions, or a depraved
action of the bowels.</p>

<p>The absorbent earths are a more useful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
remedy in this form of the disease. They
have, perhaps, a restringent effect independent
of their power of absorbing acid. It
is certain, however, that great part of their
use consists in the destruction of acid, which
is very apt to be generated in that depraved
state of digestion which takes place in advanced
fluxes, particularly in this lienteric
state of the bowels. In the early and acute
state the vegetable purgatives, such as cream
of tartar, tamarinds, and manna, are proper;
but in this advanced stage they are hurtful
by the acidity and flatulence which they
produce, and both the food and medicines
should be so calculated as to avert and correct
those inconveniencies. There is something
in vegetable acids extremely unfriendly
to a weak state of the bowels in general,
tending to bring on spasmodic gripings, and
preventing a healthy digestion and assimilation,
as we know in the case of heartburn,
and of those who make use of vinegar to
check corpulency, by preventing the formation
of blood. Vegetable acids, however,
are admissible where there is a redundancy
of bile, or where the excrements are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
putrid; and Dr. Zimmerman recommends
tamarinds as a useful medicine in what he
calls the putrid dysentery.</p>

<p>Lime water has been recommended in old
flaxes, and I tried it in several cases; but,
except in one, I could not perceive any benefit
from it.</p>

<p>Absorbents may very properly be combined
in prescription with some of the compound-officinal
opiates, and a medicine will
thereby be formed, which will have at once
the advantage of an anodyne, a bitter, an
astringent, a carminative, and absorbent.
As these earths have little or no taste, they
may also be added, with propriety, to the
common drink, as in the form of the chalk
julep, or <i>decoctum album</i>. It may be thought
that here and elsewhere I have not been so
particular as I ought to be concerning the
forms and doses of medicines; but circumstances,
such as age, constitution, and symptoms,
make these, in a great measure, discretionary;
and any one who is sufficiently
conversant with physic to be entrusted with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
the charge of the sick, will have sufficient
judgement to vary his practice accordingly.
It has, therefore been my object rather to
give the general principles of treatment than
the particular forms of medicines.</p>

<p>A proper regulation of diet, as well as medicine,
is of the utmost consequence in this
disease. A free indulgence of animal food
is pernicious, particularly in the first stage
of it. In the chronic state, a moderate use
of it is allowable, and in the lienteric state
it answers better in a solid form than that of
broth, which is apt to gripe and to run
quickly through the bowels. The best general
articles of diet are farinaceous bodies;
and these are greatly improved by being
toasted brown before they are used. It was
observed, in a former part of this work, that
the flux was supposed to have been prevented,
in the fleet commanded by Sir Charles
Saunders, by throwing burnt biscuit into
the water used by the crews of the ships.
It is a good practice to put a well-burnt
toast into all that the patient drinks, and
toasted bread, or panada made of toasted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
bread or biscuit, is one of the best articles
of diet. Brackish water ought to be avoided,
as it ruffles the bowels when in so delicate
a state. Fermented liquors are improper,
except when the disease is advanced, and
where weakness and relaxation are the prevailing
symptoms. Malt liquor will hardly
ever agree, on account of its acidity and flatulence.
Of wines, Port is to be preferred
as the most strengthening; Madeira as the
least subject to acidity; and, for the common
men, no drink of the fermented kind
is safer than a moderate quantity of spirits
diluted with water.</p>

<p>Warm clothing is of the utmost consequence
in this disease, and external warmth
of the abdomen tends greatly to sooth the
bowels. I have seen good effects from a
warm gum plaster constantly worn on that
part. Though cold is in general hurtful
and unsafe, I have nevertheless known the
sailors, who, by their habits of life, are commonly
heedless, bathe in the sea when labouring
under what they call the white flux,
without any bad effects.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span></p>

<p>It sometimes happens that this disease
baffles every effort both of medicine and
diet, so that a change of climate becomes
the only resource.</p>

<p>The last cause of habitual flux that was
mentioned was the retention of <i>scybala</i>,
which keep up the irritation and tenesmus.
It is very natural to neglect purgative medicines
when there seems already to be too
great a discharge by the bowels; but there
is this inconvenience from omitting them
for a length of time, that those hard lumps
of feces, called <i>scybala</i>, are apt to collect in
the c&aelig;cum and cells of the colon, as I have
seen upon inspecting the dead bodies; and
the fibres of the intestines being weakened,
their natural strength is not sufficient to expel
them without being stimulated by a purgative.
It is therefore necessary to give some
evacuant medicine from time to time, even
though there should be no griping nor any
marks of acrimony in the intestines. Rhubarb
is allowed to be one of the best medicines
for this purpose; and I have also
known a combination of salts and sena have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
a good effect after a long neglect of purgative
medicines. It is probable, from the
durable effects produced, that these do not
operate merely by the expulsion of <i>scybala</i>;
and we can conceive that they may be of
service by the removal of certain depraved
fluid secretions, or that they may stimulate
the vessels to a more healthy action and a
more natural secretion. Be this as it will,
experience teaches that in all fluxes it is of
advantage to interpose from time to time
some purgative medicine.</p>

<p>From the preceding view of the variety of
causes which tend to keep up this disease, it
will appear that great judgement and discrimination
are necessary in varying the practice
according to circumstances; and there is
no disease in which there is room for more
attention and nicety in adapting the different
remedies to the different symptoms. We
can hereby also account for the various characters
that different remedies have had,
some having been extolled by one practitioner
while they have been pronounced insignificant
by another; for no one remedy will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
suit all the various cases of this disease. As
it is of the greatest consequence to distinguish
these cases, I have been more particular
and diffuse on this article than any other;
and having laboured under this complaint
myself, I was naturally led to take a greater
interest in its treatment, and had also thereby
a better opportunity of making observations

<h2 id="PART_III_CHAP_III">CHAP. III.</h2>

<h3 id="OF_SCURVY">Of the <span class="smcap">Scurvy</span>.</h3>

<p>I shall not be so minute either in the
description or treatment of the scurvy, as of
the preceding diseases. A detail of this kind
would lead to unnecessary prolixity and repetition;
for the prevention and cure of it
consisting in diet rather than medicine, have
been fully handled in the former parts of
this work; and the subject, in the descriptive
as well as the practical part, has, in a
manner, been exhausted by Dr. Lind. With
regard to the theoretical part, I refer the
reader to the ingenious treatise lately published
by Dr. Milman.</p>

<p>It has appeared that the principal source
of scurvy is a vitiated or scanty diet, and
that it is very much promoted by cold,
moisture, filth, sloth, and dejection of mind.
Hard labour has been assigned by some as a
cause; but this is not conformable to my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
observation in general, and what has been
related to have happened in the Conqueror<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>,
more particularly led me to be of a contrary
opinion.</p>

<p>The principal differences of the symptoms
of the scurvy in hot and cold climates, so far
as I have observed, are, that in the former
the livid hardness on the extremities is an
earlier symptom, and in the latter the gums
are sooner affected, and the difficulty of
breathing is a more frequent and more uneasy
symptom. This difficulty of breathing
is one of the most fatal symptoms, and is
most frequent in those cases in which
there are the fewest external marks of the
disease, and is probably that form of the
complaint which attacks a vital part by a
sort of translation from the extremities.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span></p>

<p>There is a remarkable symptom sometimes
attendant on this disease which has escaped
authors, and is mentioned in Mr. Telford’s
Report, page 23. This is the <i>nyctalopia</i>,
or weakness of the eye-sight, which was
also common in the garrison of Gibraltar<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>,
among those who were affected with the
scurvy, a disease that prevailed much during
the late siege of that place.</p>

<p>With regard to the cure, enough has been
said in the preceding parts of this work to
prove that fresh vegetables are the most effectual
antiscorbutics. I shall here mention
a fact farther in proof of this, which has not
before been taken notice of. When the
fleet arrived at Barbadoes in May, 1781,
part of the soldiers, who served as marines,
were affected with the scurvy, and being sent
to the army hospital, where, at that time,
no fresh animal food was allowed, they recovered
much faster by being confined to vegetable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
articles, than the seamen who were
fed upon fresh animal food without any fresh
vegetables.</p>

<p>It has farther appeared, that there is something
in a particular class of fruit of the
lemon and orange kind, which far surpasses
every other remedy, whether dietetic or medicinal.
Numberless instances have occurred,
in the preceding part of this work, of
men having recovered at sea from using the
juice of this fruit alone, even under all the
inconveniences of a sea diet. When the
juice is intended to be kept for a length of
time, it should be expressed and bottled, a
small quantity of spirits being added to preserve
it for if fire is used in preparing it,
as in the form of a rob, I know for certain
that its virtues will be thereby very much
impaired. It is very difficult to say upon
what principle these fruits act, for no sensible
effects are produced by them except a
small increase of some of the secretions.</p>

<p>It ought to be mentioned here as a fact of
great consequence, though very little known,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
and never, I believe, published before, that
the juice of limes and lemons is the best detergent
of any external application that has
yet been tried in scorbutic ulcers. Nothing
was found so effectual in preventing these
from spreading, and in disposing them to
heal, as an emollient poultice with<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> lemon
or lime juice sprinkled on its surface; or it
was applied by soaking in it the lint with
which the sore was dressed, and also as a
lotion, in which case it was used diluted
with two or three times its quantity of water;
for if used pure, it was found too irritating,
and was apt to bring on a fungous
disposition. This precaution is particularly
necessary with regard to limes, the juice of
which is a much more concentrated acid
than that of lemons. Mr. Lucas, surgeon
of the Conqueror, favoured me with several
valuable remarks in proof of this practice.
A poultice was always found a good application
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
in these cases, by its power of absorbing
the acrimonious discharge, which would
otherwise irritate the neighbouring parts.
I have been informed by a navy surgeon,
who served in the former war, that he has
known the most obstinate ulcers cured by
applying a paste of oatmeal and water, the
surface of which was sprinkled with Goulard’s
preparation of lead.</p>

<p>The fleet was furnished with essence of
malt; but its powers were so inconsiderable,
that some of the surgeons denied that it had
any. In trials, however, that were made in
an early state of the disease, it was found to
have a sensible effect in checking and removing
it. It was also found of evident use
in the bad ulcers so apt to arise in scorbutic
habits, and in this intention was superior to
the Peruvian bark as an internal alterative.
Indeed, in those ulcers that were truly scorbutic,
the bark was found to be of very little
use; and, next to what has been already
mentioned, joined to the advantages of diet,
opium was found of the greatest service in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
disposing these, as well as all other ill-conditioned
sores of hot climates, to heal.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the scorbutic habit as
distinguished from the scurvy, but there
seems to be no difference except in degree;
for a person may be laid to labour under the
disease before it betrays itself by any obvious
symptom, and it must have gathered a certain
degree of force before visible symptoms
are produced. The chief mark of this latent
and incipient stage of the disease is that
incurable state of ulcers that has been mentioned,
whether they appear spontaneously
or in consequence of slight accidents. There
is another mark of this scorbutic habit which
is not mentioned in any description of the
disease I have ever seen. It is a soft, indolent
tumour which arises under the skin on
a part which has received a small blow, or
contusion, so slight as not to break the skin.
It most commonly appears about the elbow
or fore-arm, and generally disappears without
any inconvenience, what it contains being
absorbed. A surgeon, who opened one
of them, (a practice, however, not to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
approved of) informed me that it consisted
of fluid blood. We may also reckon a languor,
or sense of weight, as one of those
marks of scurvy which occur before the
more obvious symptoms appear.</p>

<p>In this state of the disease, the articles of
lesser powers, such as malt and melasses,
may be of service by preventing its farther
progress, or the appearance of actual symptoms,
and by restoring the constitution.</p>

<p>In some of the early stages of this disease
the effervescing mixture of acids with fixed
alkali may probably also be of use. I never
could perceive any sensible benefit in those
cases in which I tried it, though some of
the gentlemen of the fleet reported to me
that they thought it of service.</p>

<p>There is no article of the <i>Materia Medica</i>
yet known that possesses any considerable
power over this disease without the assistance
of proper diet. With this assistance, however,
it is found, that whatever tends to increase
the fluid secretions, hastens very much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
the recovery of the scorbutic patient. I
have observed a very striking instance of this
in the effects of a spontaneous diarrhoea;
for I have seen those hard livid swellings on
the legs, that form one of the most constant
symptoms of this disease, almost disappear,
and the hams, from being contracted,
become flexible in the course of twelve
hours after the purging came on. I have
endeavoured to imitate this with purgatives,
but never with the same effects as the natural
looseness. A free flow of urine is also
found to promote the recovery, and vinegar
of squills is one of the most effectual medicines
in this intention. It is likewise of
singular service to excite sweat; for an obstruction
of perspiration seems to be one of
the principal constituents of the disease. The
goose skin, which is an early and constant
symptom of this disease, seems to be owing
to a constriction of the exhaling vessels.
Dover’s powder has been employed with
advantage as a sudorific, with decoction of
the woods drank warm, and plentiful warm
dilution. Camphor, combined with nitre,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
has been found one of the best remedies,
and it acts both as a diaphoretic and diuretic.</p>

<p>Such external applications as relax the
skin are found also to forward the cure.
The contraction of the hams and the livid
hardness of the calves of the legs are relieved
by emollient cataplasms. Burying the
legs in the earth, which has a sensible good
effect, seems to act on the same principle,
for it makes the parts sweat profusely.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that in the scurvy
there takes place in certain parts of the
body a stagnation of the humours in the
small vessels, particularly of the lower extremities,
and that it is to this circumstance
that the livid hardness of the fleshy parts of
the legs is owing. The effect of medicine
in removing this, must be to restore the action
of those torpid vessels, so as to bring
the stagnated fluids again into circulation<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
Purgatives seem to act upon it as they do in
the dropsy, by exciting absorption. The irritation
of the bowels and their increased
secretion thus affecting the minute vessels in
all parts of the body, is the result of that
sympathy or balance established between
every part of the system, in order to support
the harmony and effect the purposes of
the animal œconomy.</p>

<p>It has long appeared to me, that the scurvy
is owing rather to a defect of nourishment
than to a vitiated state of it. In fact,
that sort of food which is supposed most
commonly to induce the scurvy, is, in most
cases, not putrid, but is in an unnatural and
depraved state by being drained of its juices,
which run off in brine; and perhaps some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
of the more subtile and nutritious parts are
wasted by evaporation. It is not found that
salt of itself has any effect in inducing the
scurvy, and indeed it can be induced under
a state of diet in which there is no salt, as
we know from some instances quoted by Dr.
Lind; and some cases are related by Dr.
Monro and Dr. Milman, in the Medical
Transactions, which are in proof of the same
opinion. But the case most in point to prove
that it depends on a defect of aliment, is
that of Dr. Stark, who, by way of experiment
on himself, reduced his diet to the
least quantity he could subsist upon, and was
thereupon affected with the symptoms of the
sea scurvy. I have also known some symptoms
of it arise in old people in consequence
of long abstinence, owing to the want of
appetite.</p>

<p>It would appear that the aliment we take
in acts in two ways in increasing the vigour
of the body. First, by assimilation, whereby
it affords the matter of which the solids
of the body are made, in order to carry on
growth in youth; and to repair the waste of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
parts in adult age. A very small quantity
of matter is necessary for these purposes;
and as a proof of it, we see people supported
equally well with very different quantities
and qualities of food. Secondly, Food is
necessary as a stimulus, either by a power it
has of soothing the nerves of the stomach,
and the other surfaces to which it is applied,
or by its volume in distending the intestines
and blood vessels. It is upon this principle
that luxury renders the great quantities of
food we take in necessary; and those species
of food which satisfy most by their stimulus
are by no means such as are the most nutritious.
It is also upon this principle, that
in cases of accidental hardship from want
of food, or in barren and inclement countries
where food is scarce, the body is supported,
in some measure, by what contains
little or no nutritious matter, such as pure
water, or the bark of trees powdered and
kneaded into a sort of bread, as we are told
of the inhabitants of Lapland.</p>

<p>There are other familiar and well-established
facts, which prove, that either from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
the influence of disease, from habits of life,
or the nature of particular animals, life can
go on for a length of time with little or no
aliment. This is the case in fevers, in sea-sickness,
in certain singular cases that have
been recorded<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>, in torpid animals, and in
animals of cold blood. Though a man in
health will die if deprived of food for a very
few days, it does not follow that this is owing
to the want of matter to repair the
waste of the body. The craving for food,
and the faintness from long abstinence, arise
from the want of the accustomed stimulus,
especially in those who are used to live well;
and a person feels himself most refreshed by
food and drink when newly taken in, and
before it can be applied to the purpose of
nutrition.</p>

<p>As there is a continual waste and decay,
however, both of our fluids and solids, some
degree of reparation is absolutely necessary,
especially to animals of warm blood; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
such <i>ingesta</i> as would give the stimulus of
food, without being possessed of any nutritious
principle, would indeed continue life
for a certain time; but disease would ensue.
The provision used at sea answers, in a great
measure, to this description; for unless the
powers of digestion and assimilation are remarkably
strong, salt beef and biscuit, which
have been long kept, do not contain much
more nourishment than saw-dust, or the bark
of a tree, and the disease induced by this
diet is the scurvy.</p>

<p>The nature and symptoms of the scurvy
countenance this opinion: for as the means
of renewing the animal matter of our bodies
is withdrawn under this course of diet, nature,
in consequence of an accommodating
principle, observes a sort of frugality, and
the animal œconomy adopts such measures
as may be productive of the least possible
waste and corruption of the fluids. Accordingly
all the secretions become scanty; and,
in particular, one of the first symptoms of
this disease is a suppression of perspiration,
as appears by the goose-skin that attends it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
There is a paucity of urine. There is also
a great languor in the circulation, which
may be considered either as a means adopted
by nature to prevent that vitiated and effete
state of the fluids which a brisker action
might induce; or it may happen from a
want of that due supply of nourishment necessary
to produce a vigorous action of all
the functions.</p>

<p>We have a proof of this general languor
not only from the great aversion to motion,
and the great disposition to syncope, but
from the inspection of the dead body, from
which it appears that the whole circulating
system, being more flaccid and less elastic,
is subject to preternatural distention. The
heart is accordingly found enlarged in bulk,
the size of the cavities being increased; and
in the extremities, where the circulation is
naturally most languid, the small vessels
carrying the colourless part of the blood, are
so far enlarged as to admit the red part of it,
as appears by the livid colour; and where
this is the case, these vessels being unable to
carry on the circulation, a stagnation ensues,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
as is evident in those livid appearances most
common about the calves of the leg, which
feel like a hard cake. I have examined
those parts in the dead subject, and found a
want of fluidity in the contents of the vessels,
but could not discover any thing like
<i>eechymosis</i>; from which I concluded that the
colour was owing to an <i>error loci</i>, and the
hardness to stagnation and coagulation of
the fluids, and a want of action of the
vessels.</p>

<p>The incurable state of ulcers, so common
in this disease, is also what we might expect
from the defect of fresh assimilated
juices; for where a breach is made, either
by nature or accident, in the solids, particularly
of the extremities, the proper suppuration
is prevented by the depraved state
both of the fluids and vessels; and we cannot
expect that renewal of solid parts in
which healing consists, where both the instruments
and materials of its formation are
so defective.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span></p>

<p>I shall conclude what I have to say on
this subject, by shortly considering whether
or not this disease is ever contagious.</p>

<p>There is something in the nature and
history of the scurvy that would lead us at
once to pronounce that it is not infectious;
for the external causes on which it depends
are so obvious, and seem so adequate to account
for its appearance and prevalence upon
certain occasions, as at first sight to exclude
every other external cause.</p>

<p>But it seems extremely unphilosophical to
deny the reality or possibility of any thing
in Nature, from our supposed knowledge of
the means and causes she employs, particularly
in a branch of science so obscure as the
animal œconomy. Could we, therefore,
prove the point as a matter of fact, it would
be in vain to deny it, from our fancied acquaintance
with Nature’s modes of operation.</p>

<p>The facts which give a suspicion of the
scurvy being infectious are, 1st, What is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
related by Dr. Lind, that the sea scurvy
spread at one time from the naval hospital to
the people of the adjacent country. 2dly,
There occurred several instances, in the first
part of this work, of this disease prevailing
to a much greater degree in some<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> particular
ships than others, though upon the most
accurate inquiry there was found no difference
in the diet, or any other external or
predisposing cause adequate to account for
this. We can conceive, that those ships
having accidentally a few men, whose constitutions
were remarkably predisposed to
this disease, might catch it earlier than in
other ships, and communicate it to the rest
of the crew.</p>

<p>The only practical inference that would lie
from the establishment of this fact would be,
that when the disease begins first to appear,
the men affected should be separated from the
rest; and this is a good practice, whether
this opinion is true or not; for such men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
ought to be put in one mess, in order that
they all may live upon the same antiscorbutic
articles of diet, and that they may more easily
be debarred from the use of their common
provisions, of which this disease does
not make them lose the relish.

<p>Though surgery was not properly in
my department, yet, having had a fair opportunity
of collecting facts concerning this
branch of practice, I thought it my duty to
pay some attention to it.</p>

<p>The whole number of men wounded in
the actions of April, 1782, amounted to eight
hundred and ten.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span></p>

<p>Of these, sixty died on board before the
end of the month, five in the course of the
following month, and two in June.</p>

<p>There were ninety-seven wounded men
sent to the hospital at Port Royal, of whom
there had died twenty-one when the fleet left
Jamaica on the 17th of July.</p>

<p>So that the whole loss of men in the battles
of April, and their consequences, is as
follows:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Killed outright</td>
    <td class="tdr">266</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdc">Total</td>
    <td class="bt tdr">354</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Of those who died on board, fifteen<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> were
carried off with the Symptoms of the locked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
jaw; but of those sent to the hospital, only
one. The reason that so few in proportion
were affected with it in the hospital may
have been, that none of the wounded were
landed till near the end of the third week
after the principal action. The danger of
this symptom was then, in a great measure,
past, though I have known it to take place
in every period from the second or third day
till the fourth week.</p>

<p>Only three men in the whole fleet recovered
from this alarming complaint; and as
it is interesting to know every thing relating
to so desperate a symptom, I shall give a
short account of each.</p>

<p>The first was a seaman of the Montagu,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
who had his thigh wounded by a splinter
which carried away part of the integuments
and <i>membrana adiposa</i>, and lacerated in a small
degree the <i>vastus externus</i> muscle. The
wound did extremely well till the 23d day,
when the jaw became almost entirely fixed,
and the whole muscles of the wounded side
were thrown into frequent spasms. Mr.
Young, the surgeon, who was always anxious
and assiduous in his duty, consulted with me,
and we had immediate recourse to the warm
bath, which gave a degree of instantaneous
relief, and was repeated twice a day for half
an hour. He was sensibly better every time;
in nine days was entirely free of the symptom,
and continued afterwards to do well.
The only other means taken for this man’s
recovery, besides what were used with the
other wounded men, were from three to five
grains of opium, which he took every day,
in divided doses.</p>

<p>The next was a seaman of thirty years of
age, belonging to the Magnificent, who had
the <i>humerus</i> broken and shattered by a splinter
which entered the deltoid muscle. Several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
large portions of bone were extracted,
and the artery was laid bare on the inside.
On the fifth day there came on a large ichorous
discharge, with a low quick pulse and
depressed spirits, and the jaws began to close,
with pain and stricture on both sides about
the articulation of the lower jaw. He had
every day since the accident taken half an
ounce of Peruvian bark, combined with
opium or rhubarb, according as it made him
loose or costive. This was continued, and
the part externally was kept constantly moist
all round with volatile liniment, to which a
fourth part of <i>tinctura thebaica</i> was added.
Next day the jaw was almost entirely fixed,
so that it was with difficulty that a little
wine and water could be introduced with a
spoon. Mr. Harris, the surgeon, now wisely
determining to do something vigorous in
this unpromising situation, beat up twelve
ounces of opium moistened to the consistence
of a cataplasm with the thebaic tincture,
and applied one half to each side of
the jaw. The patient this day swallowed
a pint of the bark decoction with half an
ounce of nitre, and took a diaphoretic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
draught of twenty drops of thebaic tincture
and thirty of antimonial wine. He had
also the smoke of tobacco thrown up his
nostrils.</p>

<p>On the third day after the attack he could
open his mouth half an inch. The cataplasms
were taken off, beat up afresh with
the tincture, and applied anew. The bark
and other medicines were continued. On
the fourth day the stricture and pain of the
jaw went entirely off, but the cataplasm and
volatile liniment were applied for three days
longer. The wound produced a laudable
discharge, every symptom became favourable,
and he continued to recover.</p>

<p>The only other person who recovered from
this symptom was a man in the Bedford.
Several died of it on board of this ship; and
as the same means of relief were skilfully
employed in all the cases by Mr. Wickes,
the surgeon, the success seemed owing more
to something favourable in the man’s constitution,
than any thing peculiar in the treatment,
which consisted in the administration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
of the warm bath, opium and camphor, with
mercurial friction on the jaw.</p>

<p>This accident affected some ships remarkably
more than others, particularly the Barfleur
and Bedford, though their wounds had
nothing peculiar, nor were in a greater proportion
than in the rest of the fleet. Four
were carried off by it in each of these ships.
It has formerly been observed, that great
ships acquire peculiar habits, or dispositions,
which incline the constitutions of the men to
one disease more than another. This complaint
took a run in some particular ships last
year also after the battle of the Chesapeak;
and I have known it prevail in some particular
hospitals more than others. In the
present instance, it may have been owing
either to something peculiar in the constitution,
or air of the ships; or we can conceive
it to be owing to some sort of nervous
sympathy, just as the <i>epilepsy</i><a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> has been
known to spread from one boy to another,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
at a school, in consequence of imitation,
dread, horror, or some such delicate nervous
or mental affection. We have in yawning
an example of a spasmodic affection spreading
from one person to another. If this is
the case in the locked jaw, those affected by
it should be removed from the presence of
the other wounded men, lest the idea of the
sufferings of others should be so fixed in
their mind, or so impress them with the
fear of the like, as to invite the attack of
the same complaint.</p>

<p>Though the locked jaw, in consequence of
wounds, resembles frequently in its symptoms
the tetanus which arises without any
external accident, yet there are many cases
of the former which differ materially from
the violent symptoms of the other, as described
by authors. In most cases of the
locked jaw from wounds the spasms are not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
so general, so violent, nor attended with
such exquisite pain. It sometimes happens
that the convulsive twitchings are even accompanied
with a sort of pleasure, as in the
case of a lieutenant of the Montagu, whose
case was related to me by Mr. Young, the
surgeon of that ship, a man of skill and observation
in his profession, and upon whose fidelity
and accuracy I could perfectly rely. This
officer had been wounded in the elbow at the
battle of St. Christopher’s by a splinter,
whereby the capsular ligament of the joint
was injured. On the ninth day, symptoms
of the locked jaw came on, and soon after
the whole muscles of the wounded side were
affected with frequent convulsive twitchings,
which, as he himself said, afforded a pleasant
sensation, exciting laughing like an agreeable
titillation. He died on the fourth day after
it came on, and had no pain to the last.</p>

<p>The locked jaw from accident differs also
from other cases of tetanus, in respect to its
cure; for the latter has been successfully
treated by cold bathing, as is related by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
Dr Wright<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> and Dr. Cochrane<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>; but it is
acknowledged by the latter that this treatment
did not answer when the complaint
proceeded from a wound.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked, that the locked jaw
did not take place in those cases in which the
wounds had a foul and gangrenous appearance
more than others; for those that digested
and cicatrized favourably, were equally
apt to be affected by it; and though amputations
are most liable to this symptom, the
slightest injuries, even a scratch, will sometimes
bring it on.</p>

<p>It would be difficult, therefore, to establish
any particular treatment that would
tend to prevent accidents of this kind; but
Mr. Bassan, surgeon of the Arrogant, one
of the line-of-battle ships engaged on the
12th of April, mixed laudanum with the
dressings of all the wounds, and no locked
jaw occurred.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span></p>

<p>In the Bedford there occurred a curious
circumstance concerning this complaint. In
one of the cases that proved fatal, the symptoms
did not come on till the wound was so
far healed that all dressing had been laid
aside.</p>

<p>Mr. Wood, surgeon of the hospital at Jamaica,
informed me, that in cases of the
locked jaw from injuries to small members,
such as fingers, he had tried the effect of
amputating the part after the symptoms had
come on, but without any effect in putting
a stop to them.</p>

<p>Would it not appear, from the two last
mentioned facts, that this symptom is not
kept up, nor even takes place in the first instance,
from an immediate present irritation,
but that the constitution comes to be so modified,
or receives such an impulse, as it
were, that the complaint runs its course
independent of the presence of that <i>stimulus</i>
which excites it?</p>

<p>It would be difficult to assign a satisfactory
reason why this accident is more frequent in
hot than in cold climates. The effect of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>
external heat upon the living body is not to
raise its temperature even when the heat of
the air exceeds that of the body<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>; so that we
are to seek for the effects of it in some of
those affections peculiar to animal life. And
as the outward temperature of the air does
not affect the general mass of the body, all
the effects produced by it must depend on
impressions made on the external surface of
the body and lungs; and the skin, which
may be considered as a large expanded tissue
of nervous fibres endowed with universal
sympathy and great sensibility, affects every
organ and every function of the body, according
to the state of the air in contact with
it, whether cold or hot, moist or dry, pure
or vitiated. This sympathetic sensibility of
the skin is chiefly affected by the state of
the perspiring pores on its surface; for it is
only when these are open that the impression
of the air on the skin produces catarrhs,
rheumatisms, and internal inflammations in
cold climates; and the external temperature
in hot climates being such as to keep the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
pores almost always open, this seems to be a
principal reason of that universal irritability
prevailing there, and of the general sympathy
that prevails between every part, particularly
as connected with the organs of perspiration<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>.
This readiness of one part to
be affected by another in hot climates is well
illustrated by the sudden translation of certain
diseases. I have seen, for instance, a
catarrh cease, and be converted, as it were,
into a diarrhœa, and this as quickly disappearing,
a pain in the foot would arise, like
an attack of the gout. All this would happen
in the space of a few hours.</p>

<p>But, in cold climates, wounds are by no
means exempt from the locked jaw; for it
sometimes occurs in England, where I have
seen it even in the winter season<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span></p>

<p>Since my return to England I have received
some new and useful information on
this subject in conversing with Dr. Warren,
physician to the King; and as any observations
derived from so much acknowledged
skill and sagacity must be valuable, I shall
here relate what he was so kind as to communicate
to me.</p>

<p>This eminent physician, in attending a
case in which he was nearly interested, and
in which his endeavours were rewarded with
success, found the greatest benefit from
opium and the warm bath. The opium was
given in the form of tincture, in moderate,
but pretty frequent, doses. The bath was
composed of milk and water, and the addition
of milk was, no doubt, an improvement;
for there is something in this as well
as oil extremely soothing to the human
nerves. Dr. Warren had intended to make
trial of a bath of oil in case this had failed.
He mentioned the following observation,
with regard to the external application of
oil, which could only have been suggested
by that anxious attention that was paid to
the case. It was found, that the uneasiness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
arising from the spasm was allayed by constantly
drawing a feather wetted with oil
over the temples, which had an evident effect
in lulling the pain and spasm; for when
this operation was left off, there was an immediate
recurrence of these symptoms<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>.</p>

<p>It would appear, therefore, from this as
well as the former cases, that opium and
the warm bath are the only remedies yet
known which are of service in this complaint,
and much will depend on the judicious management
of them. The method of administering
the opium, recommended by Dr.
Warren, seems to be the most judicious,
especially in constitutions not habituated to
this medicine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span></p>

<p>There is a certain medium in giving opium,
by which its best effects are obtained, for in
an under dose it will produce disturbance instead
of rest; and when it is given in large
quantities it frequently defeats the very end
for which it is given, by throwing the body
into convulsions which terminate in death.
The rule for judging of the proper limits of
this dose is, by its effect in inducing that
stupor or insensibility which renders the
senses incapable of irritation; for in this,
as well as in every other case of disease, the
cure seems ultimately to be the work of nature,
the effect of medicine being only a secondary
operation, by which it removes
some obstacle to the natural efforts of the
constitution. Though a dose of opium
greater than ordinary is required to produce
this insensibility in cases of spasm, and
though the constitution in that situation will
bear more, yet even here it may be given to
excess; and by beginning with small quantities,
and giving it in frequent rather than
large doses, the constitution will thereby be
better reconciled to it, and it will also with
more convenience admit of that gradual increase
which is peculiarly necessary with this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>
medicine. These ideas were suggested to me
by Dr. Warren; and it may be farther added,
in recommendation of his method, that the
liquid form is preferable to the solid, as the
effects of it will sooner be seen, and a better
judgement can be formed how far it is proper
to push it.</p>

<p>Great attention is also necessary in regulating
the heat of the bath; for if it is not
sufficiently warm, it will not have the effect
of producing a due relaxation; and if it
should be too hot, it will stimulate too
much, and will have the farther inconvenience
of making the patient very faint in a
short time. It cannot be well regulated
without a thermometer, and 93&deg; upon Fahrenheit’s
scale is perhaps the best temperature.
I have kept a patient in a bath of
that heat for six hours, which he could not
have endured for half an hour had the heat
been three or four degrees higher.</p>

<p>The circumstance next in consequence, in
the cure of this complaint, is the keeping
up a moisture on the skin, and guarding the
surface of the body from the access of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>
air. This is particularly necessary with regard
to the part itself, which should be constantly
enveloped in warm, anodyne, and
emollient applications. The good effects of
this is particularly exemplified in the case
which recovered under the care of Mr. Harris,
who gave the diaphoretic medicine, composed
of antimonial wine and laudanum, and
applied the anodyne cataplasm to the external
<i>fauces</i>. It was remarked, that the locked
jaw was most incident to those wounded
men who lay in parts of the hospital where
they were exposed to a current of air; and
the cases of tetanus that most usually occur
in the West Indies, independent of wounds,
are those of slaves who fall asleep in the
night-time in the open air.</p>

<p>Since the first edition of this work, there
has appeared an Essay on the Locked Jaw
by Dr. Rush, physician to the American
army in the late war, in which he recommends,
from his own observation, Peruvian
bark, wine, and blisters, and to dress the
wounds with mercurial ointment, in the
cure of this complaint. From some trials I
have since made of the bark in St. Thomas’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
hospital, I have reason to think well of it as
a remedy in this disease.</p>

<p>There is a singular species of accident to
which engagements at sea are liable, the <small>WIND
OF A BALL</small>, as it is called. If a cannon ball
in its flight passes close to any part of the body,
it renders it livid and numb for some time<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>.
It is most dangerous when it approaches the
stomach; and there was an instance of a
man in the last battle, who, upon a ball
passing close to his stomach, dropped down
dead instantaneously, without the least visible
marks of injury. Another, in consequence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
of a ball passing close to his belly,
remained without sense or motion for some
time, and a large livid tumor arose on the
part, but he recovered. I attended a man
at the hospital at Barbadoes, who had the
buttons of his trowsers carried off by a
cannon ball, without its having touched the
body. The <i>pubis</i> was livid and swelled for
some time after: he suffered exquisite pain
from strangury, which seemed to proceed
from a <i>paralysis</i> of the bladder, for he voided
no water without a catheter for near three
months, after which time he recovered. I
know a brave young officer<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> in the army,
who had his epaulette carried off by a cannon
ball at Charlestown, in consequence of
which the shoulder and adjacent parts of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>
neck were affected for some time. A like
accident happened to a marine officer in one
of the late engagements; but in neither of
these was the head materially affected, nor
is it so apt to be affected in this way as the
stomach. I never knew death the consequence
of the wind of a ball on the head;
though an officer<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> in the Sultan, at the battle
of Grenada, was so stunned by a shot
passing near his temple, as to be insensible
for some time, but he recovered entirely in a
few hours<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a>.</p>

<p>The class of wounds most peculiar to a sea
engagement are scorches from the accidental
explosion of gunpowder; and in most of the
campaigns in which I have served they have
been very frequent and fatal. Few accidents,
however, of this kind happened in the late
engagements; so that we had but little experience
of this sort of wounds in April, 1782.
But on former occasions they were very frequent,
and the best application to the burnt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
parts was found to be linseed oil, which
some of the surgeons mixed with lime water,
others with cerusse, and both compositions
answered well. Opium was found of
great use in alleviating pain and procuring
rest, care being taken to guard against costiveness
by the use of clysters. In the battles
of 1780 and 1781, one-fourth part of
the whole killed and wounded was from this
sort of accident; but on the 9th and 12th of
April, 1782, only two accidental explosions
of gunpowder happened in the whole fleet,
by one of which one life was lost, by the
other, two. This difference was owing
partly to greater experience and habits of
caution acquired in the course of the war,
and partly to certain improved methods in
working the artillery introduced by Sir
Charles Douglas, which, like all his other
valuable improvements, tend to give facility
and expedition, as well as to save the lives of
men. The circumstances which tend to prevent
explosions are, 1st, The wetting of the
wads, which prevents their inflaming and
blowing back when they fight the weather
side of the ship; a circumstance which, without
this precaution, gives occasion to a number
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
of accidents by the burning parts catching
the loose powder, or setting fire to the
cartridges. 2dly, The use of goose-quill
tubes and small priming boxes, made of tin,
instead of the large horns formerly in use,
whereby great quantities of powder were
scattered about and exposed to accidental fire.
3dly, The use of locks, which was practised
with great success in several ships, and
was found to make the operation both more
safe and more expeditious.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that men bleed to
death before assistance can be procured, or
lose so much blood as not to be able to go
through an operation. In order to prevent
this, it has been proposed, and on some occasions
practised, to make each man carry
about him a garter, or piece of rope-yarn, in
order to bind up a limb in case of profuse
bleeding. If it should be objected, that this,
from its solemnity, may be apt to intimidate
common men, officers at least should make
use of some such precaution, especially as
many of them, and those of the highest rank,
are stationed on the quarter deck, which is
one of the most exposed situations, and far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
removed from the cockpit, where the surgeon
and his assistants are placed. This was
the cause of the death of Captain Bayne, of
the Alfred, who, having had his knee so
shattered with a round shot, that it was necessary
to amputate the limb, expired under
the operation, in consequence of the weakness
induced by loss of blood in carrying him
so far. As the Admiral, on these occasions,
allowed me the honour of being at his side,
I carried in my pocket several tourniquets of
a simple construction, in case accidents to
any person on the quarter deck should have
required their use.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens, however, that no
h&aelig;morrhage arises from a limb being carried
off by a ball. The surgeon of the Fame related
to me an instance of this, in which the
thigh was cut through by a shot near its upper
part, all except a little flesh and skin, and
yet not the least h&aelig;morrhage followed. This
may have been owing to the limb being entirely
severed, or nearly so, whereby the vessels
contracted more easily than if they had
been partially divided. All that was done for
this man was to remove the limb, and to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
saw off the jagged end of the bone. He
survived six days, still without bleeding, and
died of the locked jaw.</p>

<p>I was informed by several of the surgeons,
that the method of taking up the vessels
by the <i>tenaculum</i> was found to answer extremely
well; and many of them imagined
that the locked jaw was not so apt to be
brought on by this mode of operation as by
that of the needle. But it is hardly to be
attempted in time of action, for want of
steadiness and a good light, and it was chiefly
at the hospitals that this practice was found
so successful.</p>

<p>Mr. Alanson’s method of amputation by a
great retraction of the muscles, so that the
fleshy parts shall meet over the bone and unite
in the first intention, was attended with great
success in the West Indies, particularly at the
hospital at St. Lucia, under the care of Mr.
Bulcock.</p>

<p>It may be remarked, that though all sores
and wounds in the foot and leg are difficult
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
of cure in a hot climate, I have observed,
that, where the constitution is good, those
in the thighs, arms, trunk, and head, are
rather more easy of cure than in Europe,
and that parts divided by incision very readily
unite by the first intention. In reasoning
upon this, it may be said, that as healing
depends on a certain degree of vigour in
the powers of life, this should not err either
on the side of excess or defect. If it is too
great, as in the case of a hale, plethoric
constitution in a cold climate, too much inflammation
is apt to be excited; and if too
feeble, as happens in a hot climate, in the
lower extremities, which are far removed
from the source of life and circulation, the
salutary effort is not strong enough to generate
new organised parts. But in the trunk
of the body, in such a climate, the powers
of the animal œconomy are in that just medium
which is most favourable to this operation
of nature.</p>

<h5>THE END.

<span class="x-small">TO</span><br />

<span class="x-large">PART III.</span></p>

<p>It has been suggested to me, that it would
add to the utility of this Work to subjoin a
list of the remedies best suited to the practice
of physic at sea, with their quantities,
and to give a set of formulas for the direction
of young practitioners. I have accordingly
made out a gross computation of the
requisite quantities of the most useful and
necessary articles of the Materia Medica, and
also a few of the most commodious and simple
forms of administering some of the most
efficacious remedies for the most common
diseases.</p>

<p>It is of consequence every where, but
especially on board of a ship, to simplify
practice, as much as possible, with regard to
the number, the preparation, and the administration
of medicines. Where a great
number of compound medicines are given,
it is extremely difficult to ascertain, by accurate
and satisfactory observations, what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span>
are their real effects; and as there are not
conveniences at sea for great pharmaceutical
nicety, the plainest forms should be adhered
to. And as all operations are rendered more
practicable and easy by being reduced to a
stated method, this is an additional inducement
for studying plainness and simplicity
in preparing and administering remedies.
This uniformity is more attainable in the
public service than in private practice; for
in the former all the patients are of one sex,
they are all adults, and they are generally
of robust constitutions.</p>

<p>In the list hereto subjoined the articles
are distinguished into <small>PRINCIPAL</small> and <small>SECONDARY</small>;
and when a surgeon considers how
limited his funds are, I hope he will not
think that I have made a disproportionate
assortment in reducing the number and quantities
of the latter, my view in this having
been that he may better afford an ample
proportion of such medicines as are
really efficacious and indispensable in the
cure of diseases. It may be affirmed, without
vanity or arrogance, that the printed
list of articles with which the navy surgeons
are enjoined to supply themselves is
very injudicious considering the present improved
state of the medical art; and it is of
great importance that the due proportion of
each article should be ascertained as nearly as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span>
possible, that no unnecessary expence may
be incurred, and that the chest may not be
encumbered with unnecessary articles.</p>

<p>There are no simple distilled waters in the
following list, as they are very corruptible,
and too bulky to carry to sea. Their place
is supplied by a small quantity of oil of mint,
which may be occasionally added to common
water, in the proportion of a drop to an
ounce. There are no tinctures inserted, except
laudanum, the traumatic balsam, and
compound spirit of lavender, as the surgeon,
having a proper supply of spirit of wine
or rum, may make them on board of the
ship.</p>

<p>In the following list the surgical articles
are not enumerated. There is a new article
which I beg leave to recommend, as it has
lately been found extremely useful, and is
now used in large quantities in the hospitals
in London. This is linseed meal for poultices.
The surgeon should also be provided
with a sufficient quantity of linseed oil, as it
has been found to be one of the best ingredients
in dressings for scorches. <a href="#Page_540">See page
540.</a></p>

<p>The quantity of each article is adapted to
an hundred men for one year, so that a calculation
can easily be made for any number
of men, and for any length of time.

<h4>REMARKS.</h4>

<p>During the course of last month we had one hundred
and fourteen of the men, who contracted the scurvy in
the late long cruise, recovered by the use of limes, which
were procured at Montserrat. A pint of wine, with an
equal quantity of water, made agreeable with sugar and
tamarinds, is served to each patient daily. The regimen
is exactly the same as mentioned last month.</p>

<p>Since we came into port, very few have been seized
with scurvy, but several complain daily of fluxes and
feverish complaints, none of which seem at present to be
of any consequence.</p>

<p>Four patients have last month complained of an almost
total blindness towards evening, accompanied with
head-ach, vertigo, nausea, and a sense of weight about
the precordia. The pupil is then extremely dilated, but
contracts readily when a strong light is presented to it.
Two of them had the scurvy in a high degree, one of
them slightly, and the other seemed entirely free from it.
I am not well acquainted with the nature or cure of this
disease, which I believe is called Nyctalopia by some
systematic writers.</p>

<p>I gave those who were affected with it an emetic,
which brought up a great deal of bile, and relieved the
symptoms both of the head and stomach. This encouraged
me to a repetition of it, which seemed also to be
attended with benefit. I likewise applied blisters behind
the ears, and gave bark and elixir of vitriol, with the
antiscorbutic course, to those that required it.</p>

<p>I can form no probable conjecture concerning the
cause of this disease. I have observed a dilation of the
pupil in scorbutic patients, and they complained of a
cloud before their eyes, with imperfect vision, which
disappeared as the scurvy went off.</p>

 Although this hurricane, in itself and its consequences,
was so destructive to the lives and health of
men, yet, with regard to the inhabitants on shore, it
had a surprising and unexpected effect in mending their
health. I wrote an account of this hurricane to the
late Dr. Hunter, who communicated it to the Royal
Society, and the following passage is extracted from it:</p>

<p>“The consequences of this general tumult of nature,
on the health of man, was none of the least curious of
its effects. I made much inquiry on this head, not
only of the medical gentlemen who had the charge of
hospitals, and of the physicians of the country, but of
the inhabitants, and every one had some cure to relate
either of themselves or their neighbours, in a variety of
diseases. Nor could I find that either those who were
in health, or those who were ill of any disease whatever
suffered from it, otherwise than by its mechanical
violence; but, on the contrary, that there was a general
amendment of health. This is a fact, which I could
neither credit, nor would venture to relate, were it not
supported by so many concurring testimonies. It had
a visible good effect on the acute diseases of the climate.
The chronic fluxes, of which there were then some at
the naval hospital, were cured or much relieved by it.
But the diseases upon which it had most evident and
sensible effects, were pulmonic consumptions. Some
recent cases of phthisis, and even the acute state of
pleurisy, was cured by it; and in the advanced and incurable
state of it, the hectic fever was removed, and
remarkable temporary relief afforded. A delicate lady
of my acquaintance, who was ill of a pleurisy at the
time, and passed more than ten hours in the open air,
sitting generally several inches deep in water, found
herself free of complaint next day; had no return of it;
and when I saw her a few weeks after, was in much
better health and looks then usual. The people observed
that they had remarkably keen appetites for
some time after, and the surviving part of them became
uncommonly healthy; some of both sexes, whom I
had left fallow and thin a few months before, looking
now fresh and plump.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to account for this, as well as every
thing else in the animal œconomy; but it was probably
owing in part, at least, to the very great coldness and
purity of the air from the upper regions of the atmosphere.
Great agitation of mind sometimes also produces
a revolution in health; and we know that the
effect of external impressions in general is very different
when the mind is vacant, from what it is when occupied
and interested by objects, whether of pleasure and satisfaction,
or of danger and suffering.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">4</a>
 In order to ascertain more exactly the degree of
sickness in each month, a column was afterwards added
to the form of the returns, expressing the number taken
ill of the several diseases in the course of the month.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">5</a>
 I was informed by Captain Caldwell, that when he
commanded the Hannibal, of 50 guns, his crew was so
much afflicted with the scurvy, in a passage of nine
weeks from St. Helena to Crookhaven, in Ireland, that
ninety-two men were confined to their hammocks in the
last stage of that disease, though they had been supplied
with sugar at St. Helena, and served with it on the passage.
They remained three weeks at Crookhaven; at
the end of which time every man was fit for duty: and
though they had fresh provision, they had no fresh vegetables,
so that their cure is to be ascribed to the use of
lemons and oranges, which the Captain very humanely
ordered to be purchased for them from on board of a
foreign ship that happened to put into the same harbour.</p></div>

 They were the Formidable and Namur, of 90 guns;

 The mortification in the shoulder, mentioned above,
was somewhat singular. It happened to a man in the
Yarmouth, who, after being for a week ill of a fever
and flux, was one day, early in the morning, seized
with a pain in the upper part of the right arm, which
immediately began to mortify. He soon after became
convulsed, and died the same day about two o’clock.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">11</a>
 Earthquakes are frequent in the West Indies, and
perhaps proceed from a weaker operation of the same
cause that originally produced the islands themselves,
which seem all to have been raised from the sea by subterraneous
fire. There are evident vestiges of volcanoes
in them all, except Barbadoes; but there are other unequivocal
marks of this island having been raised from
the bottom of the sea; for it is entirely formed of coral,
and other sub-marine productions, of which the strata
are broken, and the parts set at angles to each other, as
might be expected from such a cause. There is, perhaps,
at all times in the caverns of the earth, elastic
vapour struggling to vent itself, and when near the surface,
it may sometimes overcome the incumbent masses
of matter, and produce certain convulsions of nature.
In the account of the hurricane which I wrote to Dr.
Hunter, I gave reasons for believing, from the testimony
of the inhabitants, that hurricanes are attended with
earthquakes; and if a conjecture might be advanced concerning
the cause of this, it might be said, that as the
atmosphere is lighter at that time, by several inches of
the barometer, the elastic vapour, confined by the weight
of the incumbent earth and atmosphere, being less compressed,
may exert some sensible effects, producing a sort
of explosion.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">12</a>
 Since the publication of the first edition of this
work I have been informed that this complaint is not so
rare on shore as in the fleet, which may be partly owing
to the greater coolness of the air at sea, and partly from
the seamen not having been a sufficient length of time in
the climate to be affected with this disease, as few of
them had been more than two years from England.
But as this affection of the liver was very common in the
fleets and naval hospitals in the East Indies, it is evident
that there is a great difference of the climates in this respect.
It is worth remarking, that it sometimes breaks
out in the West-India Islands like an epidemic. The
complaint, for instance, was very little known in the
island of Grenada, till about the year 1785, when it
became very frequent in a particular quarter of the island;
and the gentleman who sent the description of it to England
alledged, that there were the most unequivocal
proofs of its being contagious. It was most successfully
treated by very copious bloodletting, and in exciting a
salivation by mercury. See Dr. Duncan’s Medical Commentaries,
Decad. 2, vol. I.</p></div>

 This is well illustrated by the manner in which
Captain Nott, of the Centaur, was killed in Fort-Royal
Bay. This brave man, having carried his Ship nearer
the enemy than the rest of the line, but nevertheless at a
great distance, had his signal made to keep the line, and
having gone into his cabin, as it is said, to examine the
import of the signal, a cannon ball struck him in the groin,
and it was so far spent, that it stuck in his body. It tore
away a whole plank of the ship’s side, the splinters of
which killed a young gentleman, the only person near
him.</p></div>

 I have seen an account of the diseases of the army
at St. Lucia for a whole year, kept by Mr. Everard
Home, an ingenious gentleman belonging to the army
hospital, and it appears, that, during ten months out of
the twelve, the dysentery was the predominant disease.
This seems to contradict the opinion, that the land air
is more apt to occasion fevers than fluxes; but it is to
be remarked, that the sickness of the soldiers on this
island was not so much owing to the malignant influence
of the air, the situation of the garrison being high and
airy, as to the bad accommodations and provisions, together
with hard labour.</p></div>

 As my own stay at different ports was short, and
as my own knowledge could not extend beyond that
period, Dr. Farquarson, First Commissioner of Sick and
Wounded Seamen, very politely gave me leave to inspect

 It is proper to mention, that the name of the disease

on shore with each sick person, great accuracy is not to
be expected, as this is frequently done in a careless manner.
My returns were made with great exactness; and,
in the latter part of the war, the hospital books may also
be depended upon in this respect, the tickets, at my request,
having been made out with accuracy.</p></div>

<p>There was on board of this fleet about two thirds of
the number of men that was on board of the fleet in
1782. I cannot ascertain how many died on board of
the ships in Admiral Vernon’s fleet; but the deaths at
the hospital alone are somewhat more than what happened
to our fleet both on board and at the hospital.</p></div>

 The mortality of the army in the West Indies is
much greater; for it appears by the returns of the War
Office, that there died in the year 1780, two thousand
and thirty-six soldiers, which being calculated by the
numbers on the station, and those who arrived in the convoy
in March and July, the annual mortality is found to
be one in four. The greatness of this mortality will appear
in a still stronger light, when it is considered that
those who serve in the army are the most healthy part of
the community. When I was at the encampment at
Coxheath in the year 1779, I was politely favoured with
a sight of the returns, both of the general officers and
physician, and it appeared that in an army of ten thousand
and eighty-nine men, there died, from the 10th of
June to the 2d of November, forty-three, exclusive of
twelve who died of small pox. This being calculated,
is equal to an annual mortality of one in a hundred and
nine; and it was not half so much in the encampment of
the former year. It appears by Mr. Simpson’s tables,
that the mortality of mankind in England, from the age
of twenty to forty-five, which includes the usual age of
those who serve in the navy and army, is one in fifty.</p></div>

 It would appear, that, anciently, though the slaughter

disease was still more destructive than the sword. One
of the oldest testimonies to this purpose is in the History
of Alexander’s Expedition, by Arrian&mdash;τους μεν ἐν ταῖς

 Upwards of three thousand were also lost at sea in
ships of war belonging to the same fleets in the hurricane
of October, 1780, and in the storm in September, 1782,
in which the Ville de Paris and the other French prizes
were lost on their passage to England.</p></div>

 The authors from whom I have borrowed have been
chiefly Dr. Lind and Capt. Cook. To the former we
are indebted for the most accurate observations on the
health of seamen in hot climates; of the improvements
made by the latter, an excellent compendium may be
seen in Sir John Pringle’s Discourse before the Royal
Society, on the occasion of adjudging a prize medal to
Capt. Cook for his paper upon this subject.</p></div>

 In the late war sickness alone was not the cause of
want of success in any instance, except in the last action
in the East Indies, in which so many men were ill of the
scurvy, that there were not hands enow to manage the
guns.</p>

<p>There is another fact in history, which, though not
so applicable to this subject as those above recited, forcibly
evinces how important a study the health of men
ought to be in military affairs. When Henry V. was
about to invade France, he had an army of fifty thousand
men; but owing to a sickness which arose in the
army, in consequence of some delays in the embarkation,
their number was reduced to ten thousand at the
battle of Agincourt. The disease of which they chiefly
died was the dysentery.</p>

 It is not meant by this to insinuate that every
commander is absolutely accountable for the health of
his ship’s company, and censurable when they are sickly;
for this may depend on his predecessor in command, or a
stubborn infection may have prevailed from the original
fitting out or manning of the ship which he may not
have superintended.</p></div>

 Wherever causes are obscure, superstition naturally
ascribes them to some preternatural influence; and what
seemed farther to have encouraged this, anciently, was,
that violent epidemics occurred most frequently in camps
and at sieges where great political conjunctures were
likely to arise, in which superior powers were supposed to
interest themselves. Thus we read in Homer of fatal
diseases being sent as punishments by the gods. But the
pestilential diseases so often mentioned by poets and historians
as prevailing in cities and armies, were probably
nothing else but fevers, produced partly perhaps by the
scarcity and bad quality of provisions, but probably still
more by corrupted human effluvia, which was very apt
to he produced by the want of personal cleanliness, to
which the mode of cloathing among the ancients would
more particularly subject them, especially in camps and
besieged towns.</p></div>

 If the experiments of modern philosophy are to be
depended on, they go a certain way to account for the
unwholesomeness of air from woods in hot climates, and
in wet weather; for Dr. Ingenhousz found that the
effluvia of plants in the night time, and in the shade, are
more poisonous in hot than in cold weather; but though
there is a salubrity in the effluvia in sunshine, the heat of
the weather makes no difference with regard to this.
He found also that vegetables, when wet, yield an unwholesome
air.</p>

<p>It is difficult to ascertain how far the influence of vapours
from woods and marshes extend; but there is reason
to think that it is to a very small distance. When
the ships watered at Rock Fort, they found that if they
anchored close to the shore, so as to smell the land air,
the health of the men was affected; but upon removing
two cables length, no inconvenience was perceived. I
was informed of the following fact, in proof of the same,
by the medical gentlemen who attended the army in Jamaica:&mdash;The
garrison of Fort Augusta, which stands
very near some marshes, to which it is to leeward when
the land wind blows, was yet remarkably healthy; but
it became at one time extremely sickly upon the breaking
in of the sea in consequence of a high tide, whereby the
water which was retained in the hollows of the fort produced
a putrid moisture in the soil, exhaling a vapour
offensive to the smell, and with all the noxious effects
upon health commonly arising from the effluvia of
marshes.</p></div>

 There are some contagious diseases which cannot be
propagated but by their own peculiar infections, as has
been before observed, just as the seeds of vegetables are
necessary to continue their several species; so that if the
infectious poison were lost, so would the disease. Of
this kind are the small pox, and the other diseases to
which man is subject but once during life. There are
other diseases which produce infection without having
themselves proceeded from it. Of this kind are fevers
and fluxes.</p>

<p>But there is no infection of any kind, however virulent,
that affects indiscriminately all persons exposed to
it. If a number of persons, who never have had the
small pox, are equally exposed to it, some will be seized,
while others will escape, who will be affected at another
time, when they happen to be more susceptible. It is
doubtful how far the habit of being exposed to such specific
infections renders the body insensible to them, as
was said with regard to fevers; but there is another
principle of the animal œconomy laid down and illustrated
by Mr. Hunter, which goes at least a certain
length in explaining this variable state of the body with
respect to its susceptibility of infectious diseases. This
principle is, that the body cannot be affected by more
than one morbid action at the same time. If a person is
exposed to the small pox, for instance, while he labours
under a fever, or while he is under the influence of the
measles, he will not catch the first till the other has run
its course. It may happen, therefore, that people escape
the effect of contagion in consequence of being at the
time under the influence of some other indisposition, either
evident or latent: and supposing the body to be exposed
to a number of noxious powers at the same time,
one only could take effect. But it seems difficult to explain
why some of those who are actually seized, and
who have previously been to all appearance in equally
good health, shall have it in a very mild degree, while
in others it will be malignant and fatal. This is very remarkable
with regard to the small pox, which are in some
cases so slight, that they can hardly be called a disease,
while in others they are so malignant, as hardly to admit
of any alleviation from art. May not this, in some
measure, be explained from some of the principles above
mentioned, in the following manner:&mdash;The small pox,
in their mildest form, are attended with little or no fever,
which, therefore, is not essential to them; and
when we see them attended with various forms of fever,
and thereby prove fatal even in the most hale constitutions,
we ought not to attribute this to any thing in the
nature of the small pox, but rather to say, that they have
served as an agent in exciting a fever, for which there
happened to be some previous latent disposition, that
would not otherwise have exerted itself, and that this
disposition, or contamination, as it may be called, may
have been induced by some past exposure to morbid effluvia,
which either from habit, or some other circumstance,
may not have been sufficiently powerful to excite
the constitution to fever without some such stimulus.
Any other occasional circumstance producing disturbance
or irregularity in the functions of the body, may,
in like manner, excite any particular kind of fever to
which the body may at that time be disposed. Thus the
amputation of a limb will have this effect; also exposure
to cold or fatigue, and intemperance in eating or drinking.</p>

<p>It would appear from these considerations, that there
are certain circumstances, or temporary situations of
constitution, which invite infection, and render its effect
more certain and violent in one case than another.
There are artificial methods, however, of obtruding it,
as it were, upon the constitution, though not particularly
disposed, or even though averse to receive it; and
may not this, in some measure, account for the greater
safety of some diseases when communicated by inoculation,
than when caught in the natural way?</p>

<p>But these, as well as many other facts in animal nature,
do not admit of a satisfactory explanation upon any principle
as yet known. Even the most common operations
of the body, such as digestion and generation, when
considered in their causes and modes of action, are so obscure
and mysterious, as to be almost beyond the reach
of rational conjecture. A little reflection will teach us
the utmost modesty with regard to our knowledge of
such things; for nature seems to have innumerable ways
of working, particularly in the animal functions, to
which neither our senses can extend, nor perhaps could
our intellects comprehend them. Had we not, for instance,
been endowed with the sense of sight, nothing
could have led us even to suspect the existence of such a
body as light; and there may be numberless other subtile
and active principles pervading the universe, relative to
which we have no senses, and from the knowledge of
whose nature and exigence we must for ever be debarred.
We have, indeed, become acquainted with electricity by
an operation of reason; and animals have lately been
discovered to which the electric fluid serves as a medium
of sense through organs calculated to excite it, and to
receive and convey its impressions.</p>

<p>But there are few subjects we can study that are more
subtle and obscure than the influence of one living body
on another. There is a familiar instance of the great
subtilety of animal effluvia, and also of the fineness of
sense in a dog’s being able to trace his master through
crowds, and at a great distance; and we can conceive
that infectious matter may adhere, and be communicated
in a similar manner. We have endeavoured to illustrate
the great obscurity of its operation by an allusion to generation,
digestion, and other animal functions, with
which it is equally obscure and inexplicable. It is similar
to generation in this, that its influence does not pass
from one species of animal to another; for the poison of
the plague, that of the small pox, that of fever, and the
venereal disease, do not affect brutes<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>, nor do the infectious
diseases of brutes affect different species of them,
nor the human species. The only exception to this, that
we know of, is the bite of a mad dog.</p>

<p>From these facts, and also from what was formerly
mentioned of contagion not affecting indiscrimately all
that may be exposed to it, it would appear that some nice
coincidence of circumstances is necessary to modify an
animal body, so as to receive its action. There must be
a sort of unison, as it were, or sympathy, betwixt different
living bodies, so as to render them susceptible of
each other’s influence.</p>

<p>It is none of the least curious facts with regard to infection,
that there are some species of it by which the
body is liable to be affected only once in life. When
this is considered, it is indeed conformable to what happens
in the course of the disease itself; for, unless there
was in the body a power of resisting it, there could be no
such thing as recovery. Where the disease actually exists,
the continued presence of the poison, which is also infinitely
multiplied, would infallibly prove fatal in all
cases, unless the living powers were to become insensible
to it<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>.</p></div>

 It is sincerely to be wished that this were adopted,
and it is surprising that an article so salutary and necessary,
and so difficult to be procured on foreign stations,
should not have been the object of public attention, rather
than a mere article of luxury, such as tobacco.
But in order that it might not be a matter of choice
with seamen, it would be worth while to supply them
with it at prime cost, or even as a gratuity, and then
they might be compelled to use it for the purpose of
cleanliness. There are other articles of less importance,
but being necessary to enable men upon foreign stations
to keep themselves neat and clean, deserve to be made
the object of public instruction. These are handkerchiefs
for the neck, thread, worsted, needles, buckles,
and knives.</p></div>

 At the time I am writing this, (March 8th, 1785)
there has occurred a fact which proves the effect of time
in generating infection. There now prevails a contagious
fever in several of the hospitals in London, and, among
others, in that to which I am physician. In another hospital
it has been so violent, that there has been a vulgar
report that the plague had broke out in it. The same
fever also prevails among the poor at their own houses.
The cause of it seems to be, that the cold weather has
been uncommonly long and severe; for the frost began
early in December, and the cold has hitherto been more
like that of winter than spring. The thermometer all
this month has varied from 30&deg; to 35&deg;. Cold is favourable
to infection, by preventing ventilation; for people
exclude the air in order to keep themselves warm, and
the poor in particular do so on account of their bad
clothing, and their not being able to afford fuel to make
good fires. Heat is the great destroyer of infection, and
seems to act by evaporating, and thereby dissipating it;
and the effect of fires in apartments is to produce a constant
change of air, thereby preventing its stagnation and
corruption, and the accumulation of unwholesome effluvia.
With this view, a chimney is of great use, even
though no fire should be kept in it, as it serves for a ventilator.
But if an aperture were to be made in an apartment
merely with a view to ventilation, it should be
placed in that part of the wall next the ceiling; for foul
air naturally tends upwards, and the external air entering
at the top of a room, would not be so apt to subject
those within to the effect of cold, as it would not blow
directly upon them. There would also be this advantage
in jails, that apertures in this situation would not be so
liable to be forced for the purpose of escape as if they
were nearer the floor; and in hospitals they would be out
of reach of those who, wishing to indulge in warmth,
at the expence of pure air, might be induced to shut
the windows. But an external communication with the
air any where is of the utmost importance; and it is
observable in Mr. Howard’s account of prisons, that
the jail distemper was most frequently to be met with
where there was no chimney.</p></div>

 It is of some consequence to attend to the materials
of the seamen’s beds; for, instead of flock, they are
frequently fluffed with chopped rags, which, consisting
of old clothes, emit a disagreeable smell, and may even
contain infection.</p></div>

<p>This practice was probably founded in superstition,
rather than the knowledge of nature. That some divine
influence should be ascribed to fire was very natural, as
the principal deities of the ancients were only personifications
of the elements; and it is worthy of remark,
that their name for sulphur signifies <i>something divine</i>
το θεῖον, which was probably owing to its being found in
those chasms of the earth, in Sicily and Italy, which
were supposed to communicate with the infernal regions;
for the whole Greek mythology relating to these was
taken from the ph&aelig;nomena attending the subterraneous
fires in those parts. It is curious farther to remark, in
other instances, how facts useful to mankind, the truth
of which has been confirmed in later times by the more
enlightened knowledge of nature, were first suggested by
some superstitious circumstance. Thus the wound received
by Sarpedon could not be cured, according to the
Poet, till, by divine intimation, he was desired to apply
to it the rust of the spear with which it had been inflicted,
in consequence of which it healed. But the
weapons in those days were made of brass, so that the
rust of the spear must have been the <i>&aelig;rugo &aelig;ris</i>, which
has been found by the experience of modern surgery to be
one of the best detergents in ill-conditioned sores. It is
probably, from a false analogy, founded on some such incident,
that an idea prevails among the vulgar, which
has become proverbial, that some part taken from the
offending body is good in all external injuries. Thus
some part of a mad dog is said to have a virtue in curing
his bite. Herein may be seen the difference of that
knowledge which is suggested by superstition, and that
which is acquired by the observation of nature.</p></div>

 A fact, related in Anson’s Voyage, is also strongly

prize was taken, it was necessary to crowd the prisoners
into the hold, for fear of an insurrection, which was to
be dreaded from their numbers; yet, when they arrived

 This circumstance, in the character of the English,
is only of modern date; for we learn from Erasmus, who
was in England about two hundred and fifty years ago,
that they were then extremely slovenly. The following
passage is extracted from a letter he wrote to a physician
in York, after his return to Holland:&mdash;“Conclavia sol&acirc;
fere strata sunt argill&acirc;, tum scirpis palustribus, qui subinde
sic renovantur ut fundamentum maneat aliquoties
annos viginti sub se fovens sputa, vomitus, mictum
canum et hominum, projectam cerevisiam et piscium
reliquias, aliasque sordes non nominandas.” He
adds, that the windows were very ill calculated for ventilation,
and imputes to the closeness and filthiness of the
houses the frequent and long continued plagues with
which England was infested, and particularly the sweating
sickness, which, he says, seemed peculiar to this country.
He mentions that his own country had been freed
from the pestilence by certain changes that the State had
made in the houses, in consequence of the advice of some
learned man. Erasm. Lib. xxii. Epistol. 13.&mdash;It is
probable that the greater number of those epidemics,
called plagues, were only bad infectious fevers. What
would contribute still more to the production of infection
was the want of linen, which was hardly in use in
those days. The disappearance, or at least the great diminution
of such complaints in modern times, particularly
in London, has been ascribed to the great increase
in the proportion of vegetable food; but it is certainly
more owing to the improvement in personal cleanliness,
and to the greater spaciousness and neatness of houses.
As a farther proof of this, it may be mentioned that in
the charity, called the Charterhouse, in London, founded
by Henry the Eighth, for the maintenance and education
of poor boys, their sustenance is all animal food,
as it was at the original institution, yet they are extremely
healthy. The same observation applies to Winchester
school, which was founded some ages before that.</p>

<p>There are some passages in ancient history in confirmation
of the same opinion. Herodotus relates, that the
ancient Egyptians were the most healthy of all the nations,
except the Libyans, and he imputes this to the invariableness
of their weather, and the serenity of their
sky. But he mentions in another part of his works, that
they were also the most cleanly of all people, not only in
their household utensils, but in their persons, and that
their clothing was chiefly of linen, which it was one of
the principal studies of their life to wash and keep clean&mdash;ἑιματα
δε λινεα φορεουσι ἀιει νεοπλυτα ὲπιτηδευοντες τουτο μαλισα.
Herodot. Euterp. 37.&mdash;It is remarkable that he makes
no mention of the plague, though he gives a very minute
account of the country from his own observation, from
whence it may be naturally inferred, that it did not then
exist there, though Egypt is now so subject to it, that the
plague is supposed by many to be an endemial disease in it.
It would appear also from another passage in this historian,
that he uses the word λοιμος, which we translate <i>plague</i> in
a loose sense to signify any violent acute distemper; for
he relates that a great part of the army of Xerxes, in
their retreat from Greece, perished by the <i>plague</i> λοιμου and
dysentery, in consequence of famine. Herod. Lib. viii.

 It is proper also to observe here, that those ships
which are built of winter-felled timber are much drier
than those built of what is summer felled; and this circumstance
should have been mentioned with regard to the
Montague, for the cause of her healthiness, notwithstanding
her being a new ship, was probably from being
built of winter-felled timber. It should, therefore, be
strictly enjoined to fell the wood in winter; for those
who are employed to do it have an interest in doing it
in summer, on account of the value of the bark.</p></div>

 In the course of the passage from England to the
West Indies in February, 1782, the following directions
for using the sour krout and melasses were given in public
orders by the Admiral to the different ships of the
squadron:</p>

<p>“The allowance of sour krout made by the public
boards in England, is two pounds to each man every
week; and the Admiral orders that from a pound and
a half to two pounds (beginning with the lesser quantity,
and increasing as the men may find it palatable)
be boiled with every gallon of pease on a pease day.
The cooks are desired not to wash it, nor to put it
into the coppers till the pease are sufficiently broken.
“Half a pound is directed to be issued raw to each man
on beef days, and a quarter of a pound on pork days.
It is recommended that the allowance of vinegar be
saved, particularly on meat days. When sour krout
runs short, the pease and beef days to have the preference;
when shorter still, the pease days. Melasses
having been allowed in lieu of part of the oatmeal, in
the proportion of eleven pounds to two gallons, the
Admiral directs, that a pound of melasses be boiled
with every gallon of oatmeal on Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays, mixing it and stirring it round
with the burgoo immediately after it is drawn off.
He directs that half a pound of melasses be issued
with every three pounds of flour over and above the
common proportion of raisins; and to prevent any
abuse, it is directed that the purser’s steward pour it
into the platter with the flour of which the pudding is
made. The Admiral forbids the use of pease in lieu of
oatmeal, as has sometimes been the practice.”</p>

<p>These rules were suggested by Sir Charles Douglas,
captain of the fleet, whose benevolence is equal to his
known professional skill; and he had ascertained the utility
of the preceding directions when captain of the
Duke in the former part of the war.</p></div>

 In the French ships of war there is an oven large
enough to supply not only all the officers and sick, but
part of the crew, with soft bread every day. The advantages
attending the use of flour in place of bread are
so great and obvious, that the former will probably, in
time, be substituted entirely for the latter. There is a
proof of its being practicable to use it in place of bread
in British ships of war, even with their present conveniences,
communicated to me by Captain Caldwell.
When he commanded the Agamemnon, of 64 guns, at
New York, in the end of 1782, there happened to be no
bread in store to supply that ship on her passage to the
West Indies, and flour was given in place of it. The
men, without any inconvenience, were able to bake it
into bread for themselves, and it proved so salutary, that
Captain Caldwell ascribed the uncommon degree of
health which his men enjoyed to the use of the flour.
The only objection that can be made to it is the greater
consumption of wood occasioned by baking; but this
may be obviated by adopting the grates invented by
Mr. Brodie, in which the ovens are heated by the same
fire with which the victuals are boiled.</p></div>

of vinegar, have been made in the three last

 Instead of leaving this to the management of the
men themselves, it might be done with greater advantage
to them by instituting short allowance in the following
manner:&mdash;Let a certain proportion, suppose one
third, of the salt provisions, bread, and pease, particularly
the first, be stopped, and let the amount of this,
for the whole crew be thrown into one estimate. Let
the agent victualler pay into the purser’s hands the value
of these provisions in money, at the contract price, with
such a discount as will allow for the use of the money.
Let the purser, in return, give him a receipt, as if for
so much provisions checked. This money, being distributed
in the name of short allowance, will enable the
men to purchase vegetables, and the provisions will be
saved for a time of want, or for a cruise.</p></div>

 Since the first edition of this work was printed, I
have met with a book published by Mr. Fletcher, a
navy surgeon, in which he mentions that spices, being
antiseptic bodies, might be substituted for part of the
salt in curing provisions, and this would, no doubt, be
an improvement in the sea victualling. The quantity of
spice he proposes for every barrel of beef or pork is four
ounces of black pepper, and as much allspice, and also
eight ounces of nitre in powder. It may be farther alledged
as an advantage of spice over salt, that it would
be less apt to run into brine, which robs the meat of the
greater part of its nourishment.</p></div>

 This accident happened in the Cyclops frigate in
September, 1780. Mr. Gordon, the surgeon, favoured
me with the following account of it:</p>

<p>“Mr. Smith, an officer, John Barber and Anthony
Wright, seamen, having eat some victuals prepared in
a foul copper, complained soon after of violent gripes,
giddiness, and vomiting, and they had a few loose
stools. There was intense heat; the pulse was quick,
full, and hard; a tremor of the hands and tongue,
and wildness of the eyes. The looseness was soon
succeeded by obstinate costiveness, tension of the abdomen,
difficult breathing, and loss of deglutition.
In the night, towards the morning, there came on
insensibility, with an increase of all the symptoms,
except the heat. The body was violently convulsed,
with cold clammy sweats and coldness of the extremities.
The abdomen subsided a short time before
they died, and, before they expired, a small quantity
of greenish matter, mixed with phlegm, issued from
the mouths of two of them.</p>

<p>Thirty three other men were put upon the sick list
with similar symptoms in a less degree, and some of
them continued on the list for five or six weeks before
they perfectly recovered.”</p>

<p>It is not said what means were attempted for the recovery
of these men; but, besides emetics and milk, or
oil, a dilute solution of the fixed alkali in water has been
recommended against this poison.</p></div>

 I was furnished by Dr. Clephane, physician to the
fleet at New York, with the following fact, as a strong
proof of the excellence of this liquor:</p>

<p>In the beginning of the war two store ships, called the
Tortoise and Grampus, sailed for America under the convoy
of the D&aelig;dalus frigate. The Grampus happened to
be supplied with a sufficient quantity of porter to serve
the whole passage, which proved very long. The other
two ships were furnished with the common allowance of
spirits. The weather being unfavourable, the passage
drew out to fourteen weeks, and, upon their arrival at
New York, the D&aelig;dalus sent to the hospital a hundred
and twelve men; the Tortoise sixty-two; the greater
part of whom were in the last stage of the scurvy. The
Grampus sent only thirteen, none of whom had the
scurvy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="label">78</a>
 We have a remarkable proof of this in comparing
the fleet under the command of Admiral Byron with that
under the Count d’Estaing, when they both arrived
from Europe on the coast of America in the year 1778,
some of the British ships having been unserviceable from
the uncommon prevalence of scurvy, while the French
were not affected with it.</p></div>

 Since I came to England I have met with a pamphlet
published by Mr. Henry, of Manchester, in which
an ingenious method, founded on chemical principles, is
proposed for separating the quick lime from water; but I
fear it is too nice and complex to be brought into common
practice. It would certainly be worth the trouble;
but there are so many duties in a ship of war to call off
the attention of the men, and they are so little accustomed
to nice operations, that it would be difficult to
persuade officers to attend to it and enforce it. If a sufficient
quantity should not be precipitated by the air in
the water, and by the accidental exposure to the atmosphere,
it might be more effectually exposed to the air by
Osbridge’s machine, to be described hereafter, or by a
long-nozzled bellows, and if a small impregnation should
be left, this is rather to be desired than avoided.</p></div>

or kept constantly moist with a mop.</p>

<p>In this place I cannot help mentioning also, that in case
of great extremity it has been found that the blood may
be diluted, and thirst removed, by wetting the surface of
the body even with sea water, the vapour of which is always
fresh, and is inhaled by those pores of the skin
whose natural function it is to imbibe moisture, of which
there is always more or less in the common air of the

 When we consider that linen was not in use among
the ancient Romans, we might be apt to wonder that
they were not more unhealthy; but their substitute for
this was frequent bathing, which not only served to remove
the <i>sordes</i> adhering to the surface of the body, but
to air that part of the clothing which was usually in contact
with the skin. The washing of the bodies of men
suspected of infection upon their first entrance into a
ship, has already been mentioned, and I have known
some commanders who made their men frequently bathe
themselves with great seeming advantage.</p></div>

passages in Celsus and Hippocrates, which seem to
be illustrative of the same idea:&mdash;Quibus causa doloris,
neque sensus ejus est, his mens laborat. Celsus, Lib. ii.
cap. vii. which is nearly a translation of the following
aphorism of Hippocrates:&mdash;[Greek hOkosoi poneontes ti tou s&ocirc;matos, ta

 The form of administering this medicine was to add
twenty drops of thebaic tincture, from half a grain to a
grain of emetic tartar, and from five to ten grains of
nitre, to two ounces of water or camphorated julep, of
which one half was given about two hours before the
common hour of rest, and the remainder at that hour.
If spiritus Mindereri is preferred to the nitre, it may be
given from two drachms to half an ounce for a dose, and
it is better to administer it separately; for if it should not
be exactly neutralized, it may decompose the antimonial,
and render it inactive.</p></div>

 Since the publication of the first edition of this
work, there has appeared a small tract on the treatment
of low fevers, by Dr. Wall, of Oxford, and as his ingenuity
and learning give him a just claim to the high
rank he holds in his profession, attention is due to what
he advances. The principal scope of the work is to recommend,
from his own observation, the early use of
opiates in those fevers, and the Doctor’s authority, as
well as my own experience, convince me of the propriety
of this practice in many cases occurring in this
country, particularly among the lower sort of people,
for whom spare diet and hard labour render evacuations
less necessary than among the better sort. The inferior
class of people are also more subject to this sort of fever
from their houses and persons being less clean, and their
apartments being worse ventilated; so that practice in
these, as well as other cases, is to be varied according to
the constitution and previous habits of life.</p></div>

 In a review of Haslar hospital made in person by

it was very judiciously proposed, among other salutary
improvements, that there should be two apartments for
the reception of the sick upon their first landing; one
wherein they should be stripped of their dirty clothes,
and another in which they should go into the warm bath,
and put on the hospital dress, that they might not carry

 Great nicety is required in all cases with regard to
the times and doses of cordials; for it by no means follows
that these should be in proportion to the lowness
and loss of strength. This is well illustrated by Mr.
Hunter in his Lectures, where he explains the distinction
between the powers of the body and its <i>actions</i>.
There must be a certain degree of strength to bear the
excitement occasioned by stimulating and strengthening
medicines or diet; for nothing is more pernicious, or
even fatal, than that any part or function should make
exertions beyond its strength; and there is the more
danger in ill-timed remedies of this kind, as a state of
weakness is generally a state of irritability.</p></div>

 I have in the whole of this work been extremely
cautious in reasoning concerning causes, from an opinion
that they are very obscure, and that the theoretical
part of physic is very imperfect and fallacious. This
is perhaps in no instance more remarkable than in those
opinions that prevail concerning the nature and influence
of bile in producing diseases. An increased secretion of
bile commonly attends the feverish complaints of hot
climates, and those of the hot seasons of temperate and
cold climates. It is not unnatural, therefore, to impute
the disease then prevailing to this redundancy of bile:
but, upon considering the matter more closely, it will
appear to be rather a concomitant symptom, or effect,
than a cause of those fevers; for, in the first place, in
those cases in which there is the greatest secretion of bile,
as in the <i>cholera morbus</i>, there is no fever. The only
danger in this disease arises from the violent irritation
produced in the bowels by such an extraordinary quantity
of this secretion which commonly passes downwards;
though I have seen it prove fatal when it flowed
into the stomach, and produced perpetual retching and
excoriation of the fauces; but in this case also without
any fever. Secondly, in the most fatal of all fevers, in
the West Indies, there are no marks of an increased secretion
of bile, but, on the contrary, a preternatural
defect of it, as appears by its not being evacuated either by
stool or vomiting, by the white stools which sometimes
attend the yellow fever, and by its not appearing in the
first passages, nor in its own receptacles after death.
Perhaps also that state of the bowels which renders it so
difficult to procure stools may be in part owing to the
want of this natural stimulus. It is nevertheless true,
that in the intermitting and remitting fevers of hot climates
and seasons there is perhaps always an accumulation
of bile at the beginning, and an increased secretion
of it during their course. It is farther true, that this
adds to the patient’s uneasiness, and aggravates the
symptoms, and that the cure consists partly in the evacuation
of the bile. But it is also true, that in the
very worst sort of fevers in hot climates it is a favourable
symptom where the secretion of the liver is restored
and increased, a bilious diarrhœa being one of the most
auspicious symptoms that can occur in a yellow fever;
and in those that are protracted and afford hopes of recovery,
there is generally a gush of bile from time to
time.&mdash;We may therefore lay down the following positions:
1. That in cases in which bile is most freely and
copiously secreted no fever exists, as in <i>cholera morbus</i>.
2. That in the worst sort of fevers there is no preternatural
secretion of bile, but, on the contrary, a defect of
it. 3. That nevertheless there is an uncommon quantity
of bile secreted in most of the fevers of hot climates,
and that part of the cure consists in evacuating
it.</p>

<p>I am extremely diffident, as I have said, in all matters
depending on our supposed knowledge of the animal œconomy;
but the preceding circumstances seem to countenance
the following reasoning:&mdash;The bile, according to
Dr. Maclurg, who has given one of the best dissertations
on its nature and properties, is composed of two parts;
the gross part, which is coagulable by acids, and that
part in which the bitter principle resides. The first
constitutes the principal part in point of quantity, and
seems to be that portion of the mass of fluids which
loses the property of sound healthy blood, by a tendency
to putrefaction, and is thrown out by this secretion.
I will not undertake to vouch for the truth of
this, but shall assume it as true in the following reasoning:&mdash;According
to this theory, therefore, the greater
part of the bile is what may be called the effete part
of the circulating mass, or perhaps only of the red
globules or gluten, the watery and saline part, which
passes off by urine being the corrupted part of the serum.
This part of the bile being very liable to putrefaction,
the bitter part is considered by Dr. Maclurg as
intended to correct this, and also to answer some good
purpose in digestion. One of the effects of the bile in
this operation is to extinguish acidity, whether proceeding
from substances taken in, or generated in the stomach.
The blood in all climates, and in all situations
of life, is subject to have part of it thus corrupted,
which, being separated from the common mass by the
liver, is mingled and discharged with the common <i>feces</i>;
but external heat continued for any length of time tends
to augment this corruption of the fluids, and therefore
to increase the secretion of bile; and it has been observed
both by myself and others, that the bile found in
those bodies that have been inspected after death, in consequence
of fevers in hot climates, is less bitter, and not
so penetrating to the fingers, being therefore deficient in
the antiseptic principle. But since external heat makes
no alteration in the degree of temperature of the fluids
themselves, this effect must take place through the medium
of the solids, in consequence of that general languor
and want of energy which too much external heat
induces in the functions, particularly in that power
by which the living body preserves itself from putrefaction.
Now if this portion of the blood, thus altered
and depraved, is readily secreted and speedily thrown
out, as in <i>cholera morbus</i>, no harm befals the constitution,
nor any inconvenience but what arises from the
irritation of the <i>prim&aelig; vi&aelig;</i>. But this may not take
place if the body should be otherwise deranged; for the
removal of this noxious matter from the mass of blood
depends upon a due irritability of the blood vessels, the
liver, and the bowels, whereby they are stimulated to
contract, and thereby expel it. According to the principle
of Mr. John Hunter, (whose deep and industrious
researches into the animal œconomy place him high in
the list of those few on whom nature has bestowed real
genius, and who are capable of adding something new to
the stock of human knowledge,) there is in a state of
health a relative habitude or mutual harmony existing
between the solids and fluids, whereby they stimulate
and produce actions in each other, in which the healthy
state of the functions consists, whether employed in the
formation of what is found, or the expulsion of what is
noxious: so that where it happens that the solids have a
morbid insensibility to the impressions of corrupted and
acrimonious fluids, the retention of these adds still more
to the general derangement. To illustrate this, it may
be observed, that the stomach and bowels, when they are
endowed, as it were, with their natural perception, immediately
expel any preternatural accumulations of bile
that may take place; but when they are insensible to
this stimulus through disease, no effort is made to relieve
nature till it is excited by medicine. The same reasoning
may be applied to the various vessels and ducts.
Thus when we see the liver gorged with bile, without
any free excretion of it into the gall bladder, as I have
sometimes found to be the case upon inspecting the body
in some of the worst cases of fever, would it not appear
that the gall ducts have lost that natural irritability
whereby the bile is expelled? Or, in consequence of a
depraved state of action, connected with febrile affection,
may it not happen that the absorbents, which, in
their natural state, only absorb particular substances, and
in a given quantity, will suffer a change in this natural
action, and absorb whatever happens to be applied to
their orifices? In case of jaundice, the bile, which is
perhaps not at all absorbed in a state of health, is taken
up in large quantities, and mingled with the mass of
blood, which proves a seasonable relief in the state of accumulation
and distension occasioned by the obstruction.
This may happen in cases of fever, not indeed as a relief
to nature, but from a depraved state of irritability in the
lymphatics, induced by disease. Though no increased
quantity of bile, therefore, is found in the gall bladder,
there may have been an increased excretion of it, a preternatural
absorption having been excited. So that it
may admit of a question whether the colour of the skin,
in the yellow fever, is owing to this, or if the idea of it
given in the text<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> is more just; but in either case
it seems probable that the extreme tendency to putrefaction
in the whole body is owing either to the presence
of bile, in consequence of absorption, or the retention of
something in the blood from a defect of its secretion.</p>

<p>This reasoning concerning the bile in hot climates
may, in some sort, be illustrated by what happens to the
urine in cold climates. The urine is the vehicle of an
excrementitious part of the blood, of which an increased
proportion is generated in certain fevers, and if it is
thrown out in the form of high-coloured, turbid urine,
the fever will most probably be slight and short; but if
it becomes pellucid, or <i>crude</i>, as it is called, the general
derangement will be increased, the fever will be more
violent and dangerous, and the first sign of returning
health will be a turbid appearance and sediment.</p>

<p>If the reasoning in the above discussion should appear
to some readers unsatisfactory, or ill connected, I can
only say that if it is deserving of this character, I am
willing to have it considered not only as an illustration,
but an example of the nicety and fallacy of theoretical
disquisitions.</p></div>

 I have been very cautious of admitting any theory
into this work; but I cannot help adopting the doctrine of
my much-valued master, Dr. Cullen, on this point, viz.
that a great part of the symptoms of fever arise from reaction,
or that effort which nature makes to overcome
the morbid cause. I am happy in any opportunity of acknowledging
my obligations to this learned professor, to
whom the medical world in general is so much indebted,
as well for the rational views of the animal œconomy,
which he teaches, as for that spirit of study and inquiry
which he infuses into the minds of his pupils.</p></div>

 There is a difference in the appearance of the blood
when sizy, perhaps not sufficiently insisted on by practical
writers; for though there should even be a very
thick buff, yet, if the surface is flat, and the <i>crassamentum</i>
tender, no great inflammation is indicated, in comparison
of that state of the blood wherein the surface is
cupped, the <i>crassamentum</i> contracted so as to afford the
appearance of a large portion of <i>serum</i>, and where it
feels firm and tenacious, though perhaps but thinly covered
with buff. This is a distinction well worth attending
to in practice; for it is in these last circumstances
that blood-letting gives most relief, and where the patient
will bear the repetition of it with most advantage.</p></div>

 The red bark was brought to England in a Spanish
prize in the year 1781, and a very accurate account of
its medical and chemical properties was published the year
after by Dr. William Saunders, of Guy’s hospital. None
of it had been brought to the West Indies before the
peace, so that I had no opportunity of trying it in that
climate.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_111" href="#FNanchor_111" class="label">111</a>
 Mr. Telford related to me, that he had cured several
intermittents that had baffled the bark, by means of
white vitriol, whilst he was surgeon of the Yarmouth
in 1779. He gave it in doses of five grains every four
hours in the intermission, and was successful in every
case except two, in which the patients were far advanced
in the dropsy.</p>

<p>He met with several cases of the same kind in the Alcide,
in 1782, in which he was successful with the flowers
of zinc, after having given large quantities of bark to no
purpose. He preferred, however, the white vitriol, as
being milder in its operation, and less apt to disagree with
the patient’s stomach.</p>

<p>He did not employ either of them in the recent state
of the disease, nor does he assert that they are universal or
infallible remedies; but only alledges, that he has experienced
the most evident good effects from them in an
advanced stage of the disease, and a reduced state of the
patient, where the common remedy had failed.</p></div>

 Dr. Huck Saunders, whose recent loss the world has
reason to regret on account of his experience and sagacity
as a physician, as well as his virtues as a man, communicated
to me, in conversation, some observations on the
cure of obstinate intermittents, which deserve to be mentioned
here. When he was physician to the army at the
Havannah he cured a number of agues which had resisted
the bark, by giving two ounces of the vinous tincture of
rhubarb and six drams of the tincture of sena seven or
eight hours before the fit. This being repeated two or
three times, carried off the disease. He also informed
me, that he had met with agues in England which did
not yield to the bark; but, upon leaving it off, and putting
the patients on a course of mercury, they were cured
upon returning to the use of the bark.</p>

<p>Arsenic has also been found to be an effectual remedy
in intermittent fevers. I was informed by Dr. Huck
Saunders, that when he was in North America, in the
war before the last, there was an expedition undertaken
against the Cherokee Indians, whose country is extremely
subject to agues; and as an adequate quantity of bark
would have been very cumbersome where light service
was necessary, Mr. Russel, who had the medical management
of the expedition, provided a great number of
pills, containing each one eighth part of a grain of arsenic,
by the proper use of which he was enabled to cure
the intermittent fevers with which the troops were seized.</p>

<p>I shall here mention another unusual remedy in intermitting
fevers; and though I can bring only one instance
in proof of its efficacy, yet this is so strong as to make it
deserve farther trial. A man, on board of the Sandwich,
had an obstinate intermittent which had resisted the bark,
and was stopped by applying to the stomach a plaster,
composed of gum plaster, epispastic plaster, and opium,
in proportions which I do not now recollect.</p></div>

 There is a symptom which takes place when men are
beginning to recover from scurvy, (particularly when
the cure is rapidly effected by the use of lemon and
orange juice) upon which I have frequently reflected,
but for which I have never been able to account. This
consists in acute pains, which are felt in the breast and
limbs, resembling rheumatic pains. I once knew the
crew of a ship which was much affected with scurvy,
and had about ninety men under cure by lemons and
oranges, who were most of them affected with this
symptom in one night, and made such a noise by crying
out as to alarm the officers who were upon duty.</p></div>

 This is a fact which does not admit of doubt; but
the manner in which the effect is here produced is a matter
of conjecture. It is most probably owing to the
compression and tremor of the air in consequence of its
resistance to the motion of the ball. We can also conceive,
that, with regard to an yielding part, such as the
stomach or abdomen, a body flying with great velocity
may even, for a moment, displace a portion of it by
passing through the same space, without any other mechanical
injury than contusion, in a manner similar to
what happens to two balls in the act of collision in philosophical
experiments made to illustrate the nature of
elasticity; or the compressed air may even, in this case,
act, as it were, like a cushion, preventing the sudden
impulse and contact of the ball. This explanation furnishes
a reason why the parts of the body above mentioned
should be more liable to be affected by accidents
of this kind than the head. Perhaps this difference may
also, in part, arise from the principle laid down by Mr.
Hunter, that the stomach is more essential to life, and
more immediately the seat of it, than the head or any
other member or organ of the body, and that an injury
to this part is more immediately destructive of life than
any other.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
